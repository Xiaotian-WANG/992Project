997ac7ddebb9648d77250fbc119efad098c37a1a,Robust geomechanical characterization by analyzing the performance of shallow-learning regression methods using unsupervised clustering methods,"Abstract Sonic logging tool can acquire compressional and shear travel-time logs (DTC and DTS), which aid geomechanical characterization. Six shallow-learning regression models were trained to process 13 â€œeasy-to-acquireâ€ conventional logs for synthesizing the DTC and DTS logs. The six shallow-learning models used in this study are ordinary least squares (OLS), partial least squares (PLS), elastic net (EN), LASSO, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and artificial neural network (ANN). The shallow-learning models were trained and tested on logs from a 4240-ft depth interval in a shale reservoir in Well 1. Five clustering methods, namely, K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, self-organizing map, and Gaussian mixture model, were applied on the 13 â€œeasy-to-acquireâ€ logs. Clusters identified using the K-means clustering have a strong correlation with the performance of the shallow-learning regression models. Dimensionality reduction technique is used to visualize the performance of the clustering methods. In conclusion, sonic logs can be synthesized using shallow-learning regression models, and K-means clustering can be used to determine the reliability of the sonic-log synthesis using the shallow-learning methods.",2020,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Siddharth Misra"", ids = ""9271050""); list(name = ""Hao Li"", ids = ""144966714""); list(name = ""Jiabo He"", ids = ""31402265"")",,,,,129-155
a6542e4ba38d0701245d86ce9abb472144822440,Learning from high-dimensional multivariate signals,"Learning from high-dimensional multivariate signals by Arnau Tibau Puig Chair: Alfred O. Hero III Modern measurement systems monitor a growing number of variables at low cost. In the problem of statistically characterizing the observed measurements, budget limitations usually constrain the number n of samples that one can acquire, leading to situations where the number p of variables is much larger than n. In this situation, classical statistical methods, founded on the assumption that n is large and p is fixed, fail both in theory and in practice. A successful approach to overcome this problem is to assume a parsimonious generative model characterized by a number k of free parameters, where k is much smaller than p. In this dissertation we develop algorithms to fit low-dimensional generative models and extract relevant information from high-dimensional, multivariate signals. First, we define extensions of the well-known Scalar Shrinkage-Thresholding Operator, that we name Multidimensional and Generalized Shrinkage-Thresholding Operators, and show that these extensions arise in numerous algorithms for structured-sparse linear and non-linear regression. Using convex optimization techniques, we show that these operators, defined as the solutions to a class of convex, non-differentiable, optimization problems have an equivalent convex, low-dimensional reformulation. Our equivalence results shed light on the behavior of a general class of penalties that includes classical sparsity-inducing penalties such as the LASSO and the Group LASSO. In addition, our reformulation leads in some cases to new efficient algorithms for a variety of high-dimensional penalized estimation problems. Second, we introduce two new classes of low-dimensional factor models that account for temporal shifts commonly occurring in multivariate signals. Our first conxviii tribution, called Order Preserving Factor Analysis, can be seen as an extension of the non-negative, sparse matrix factorization model to allow for order-preserving temporal translations in the data. We develop an efficient descent algorithm to fit this model using techniques from convex and non-convex optimization. Our second contribution extends Principal Component Analysis to the analysis of observations suffering from arbitrary circular shifts, and we call it Misaligned Principal Component Analysis. We quantify the effect of the misalignments in the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix in the high-dimensional regime and develop simple algorithms to jointly estimate the principal components and the misalignment parameters. All our algorithms are validated with both synthetic and real data. The real data is a high-dimensional longitudinal gene expression dataset obtained from blood samples of individuals inoculated by different types of viruses. Our results demonstrate the benefit of applying tailored, low-dimensional models to learn from high-dimensional multivariate temporal signals.",2012,Engineering,"list(name = ""Arnau Tibau-Puig"", ids = ""1446892559"")",,019de3bca6f53fddb12a52b626b428e18de854f0; 79a946a0ece2c440b46f4d5b9c34bd567ae6166a; 20453d9a4ee9a8e3d762b768cded4ba8ca147bb3; efe5519409c823737c75e0826ae00efa325f7721; cac33f91e59f0a137b46176d74cee55c7010c3f8; 608fde2254fdefeb74c20cf2449cbb93c37d2702; 3a1b983a87a4116803fff779ecf1cd11a4b07539; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; a6f5c8d82f27bd68eb4cc40bc3d0b00fccc5d469; 7368898189d0b617659c5d20bf89d34b245d58c9; f3b07cd8ca838498af11c1cf5414e6294c392012; baa88620816472576822a08564399df5a77818a0; 941a668cb77010e032a809861427fa8b1bee8ea0; eef58d85880ab19737f4880fcff19fdc7ec1db99; a7a3046291d81a340a988775df671effb835ad93; ef6014990781d60cd052e28294e8c1075d75de1c; f6295fd69d76d606f66cc15f58767a8161d60335; bc14819e745cd7af37efd09ea29773dc0065119e; 39c467f2bcbaf5506c7420090a5236564c0b9f09; ce702d66b728acc691b3913bd6aca2ebb13cc941; cedf154c28178370d95510112413dc8cb48120a8; 22f68108d30112fcc6c5ba86ba79868e61f94f41; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 06f7a4af7e49721c55b40065010dd27b76f485ca; 0c2aea1b3b7ccd49f7f7b37416e3cb089554593f; 3b763471dbc7c26be73869784720c4ac50b5519e; c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 39ac586c519ef8569b4f401a257c29b2039d5d25; ff4b3bbb455c9cc561ddec097a869140b3c1303d; 87e43e9eba01a4eb03436c9946bf6aa031a5d5af; 6b27451fcd6d4103c75d19e12216a5ace0c65f34; 6a7f76b3b3c568ad2b6d309d778afcab1b7b0a62; c4a8564c65769cb55304e17a9f7fa64cf29d57ec; 5778fd8a5b928784a2f91840d5ccc592499160b6; e9e87e74d2aa74191acc9b045796e253ca1d1a60; 37b573e791a5e41ef3b59e6f68f58a8cbe9f8cdf; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 80db408970c1b8d4ebb664ac313bf5c452f95671; 236fe55519aa360239cfce703b686550744a8b2f; 274bc40268671fa3fff54d2ef89454b13fb026da; 911e47fb8790f692acc91d2cfd0e17d8e3f53b93; 16b7e1be4e32f9047184b38b897c1e2fc739e79e; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; b624c3af672b7012cd3f3cbfe98c086334ff3ff7; 947ef1a07054bac4667f655ab119fd345beec7bf; fc8d958db83f37923d1e7605e85bb6f0d3d1f3de; 85965720ccdc65ba0aaad60342c802e5682327f2; 9ebb5c0d6d54707a4d6181a693b6f755ec8a45a9; 4b3d5bb0f9597fff321d3d48e0d22b2cae7e648a; b4470c44344de917189264b1cfc6411b07a96e66; ee1477dcbf768cd589cdcf45ca8f9427666dfe4d; 306de9c553695822ae9e6de044b6856baf0cce7d; 3bf02f6c68f66b2fc6e40b6e7113460f4d918b0c; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; aeb21721b8ecc8be93d033114318df55cfc2589b; fc81e5f6c887bc16507d1e45a444e5fa4adb8b91; f655ce065bdb89ef58ae4e531a860124c7265e58; 9c41fe875e10e6ef08b610a5fbc2587783b6dab8; 443583c081220df4620d6ca2f53aa9a6ba30494e; 97acfae837aa37f641db24f994b59d4ead01a002; 31a7315d97641b1ee1e065000a0f528bcb25e39b; 3d95ae9504cfb904216be4f2bfda9315d0476986; fef39f3e5d1ec7aa62df5ef6e9fa1553bfab2722; a4f7b5c7e1195fbdcd3a7de61f60e5e823ab22ca; bc1eb681a5561f4f38153d274824d95fbc76e90b; 757cb62e3d1c0643c9f83bf57d45e427bd76e235; 387290646fe1f663c39ad7e545043542e10d97f3; 29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728; 844211e6603dfa5b5c2e3de9514f04e1b97288f3; e3cc69df888a87e0c8ec33105fd05865917a70a7; 07e9aba1cb1da6d92f7724422f77ddb267f6231a; f49d8df59dff02fadd26152b5585af6e753907c5; 5f56320c5979faeab78dbd9ddb7db755ba4550f3; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 63c68278418b69f60b4814fae8dd15b1b1854295; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 9a0a372123a39fc51a7131993c2f138d42f39953; a397933f32a5ffc6b42ddeb19a6638ef27432951; 7953ea921cbd3c62cac3004dafcd630e31eae81d; 7ffd2cc1919a3dfd5419d0e7c7656890154e2e18; e0a0a3172e08f26cd78eb8aeba041592c709b16d; 6e746ad498b099fa0db388134571cb69f213ab25; c7709875e6d71994d8c197df09b8945e6813b342; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 64e9a50ebaa20fb34414c3fd0668bfef93e2366c; efbb55fcaead7190b511761096279b3bce7ae4d2; 22ec25d63cdd20cfc349ba7e8b7f51d68c3cf8e8; 7c3b564bbdc8e7e3242257189ab7702d3e095115; 6484609c152bb1fffcd38ecbba42ce82db47a70e; 9067db319ecb338312070a92b081341e6f03a6c6; 82df5f036cfc2d4bcb41af27f112678aa4a22263; dcab54209c587784e7f8a37079b0ff0b0a21a86e,,,
eb0f8f802e9ace6d923a370973344733ef16d5ee,Capturing the musical brain with Lasso: Dynamic decoding of musical features from fMRI data,"We investigated neural correlates of musical feature processing with a decoding approach. To this end, we used a method that combines computational extraction of musical features with regularized multiple regression (LASSO). Optimal model parameters were determined by maximizing the decoding accuracy using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The method was applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that were collected using a naturalistic paradigm, in which participants' brain responses were recorded while they were continuously listening to pieces of real music. The dependent variables comprised musical feature time series that were computationally extracted from the stimulus. We expected timbral features to obtain a higher prediction accuracy than rhythmic and tonal ones. Moreover, we expected the areas significantly contributing to the decoding models to be consistent with areas of significant activation observed in previous research using a naturalistic paradigm with fMRI. Of the six musical features considered, five could be significantly predicted for the majority of participants. The areas significantly contributing to the optimal decoding models agreed to a great extent with results obtained in previous studies. In particular, areas in the superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus, Rolandic operculum, and cerebellum contributed to the decoding of timbral features. For the decoding of the rhythmic feature, we found the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right Heschl's gyrus, and hippocampus to contribute most. The tonal feature, however, could not be significantly predicted, suggesting a higher inter-participant variability in its neural processing. A subsequent classification experiment revealed that segments of the stimulus could be classified from the fMRI data with significant accuracy. The present findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the auditory cortex, the cerebellum and the hippocampus in the processing of musical features during continuous listening to music.",2014,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Petri Toiviainen"", ids = ""2044701""); list(name = ""Vinoo Alluri"", ids = ""2771508""); list(name = ""Elvira Brattico"", ids = ""3165077""); list(name = ""Mikkel Wallentin"", ids = ""3128994""); list(name = ""Peter Vuust"", ids = ""2684219"")",087a4d3e7090ae49f0486e6b6b9cd5d3a1b53317; 256d78d6edac95fbc1d40433e31b5d1ebf3a4553; 665e7acdb344b93d290ecc5b6de5137dbcc63d1b; 54191eb02029cdb9d8fbc31be7f709083e3c111f; aa26eda6aeac39f6300107d513d94666679abe4e; b8637b3b02027c710e8feaf64693c31bcd63a857; 973f68ca2066d0e8988473862080136ac3a411f0; de08ba7fa0be890f09fbedf8f977bb89cfa9fa58; aeccf818db2793b7ac46a3060c2b3245fc3eebd8; a68b69ea1d3eb7c174404c13082b42d26ef51be0; 5e0f0e7eda3b17b98aca3e3b87091b1f30316672; bbda8132df64c5a8fb0179b19683708766e8b667; 366cc90a1c540dc000b18e0b051b0758717b5c6b; 5d8f3b150854503d9cf0eaaa44ec3287e7a831c8; a3659144be29e6c7599e46f1a2f21906ca754f08; e5f6b645ecbd1a2f2f71872b3206a6e22c3293a1; f779e14ebe46664b9f7d010c45bdb4d6de8a9c12; 6194f87aaea57220d35d734e704baf345c4bc769; 6fc232d1d4551b6ab7ecd7f67912bb8dbfb6c8e5; 74198763d71d898ec71e69c1e8ce899fa341b059; 1c7bb61fedb580d1ff03d7317c24f3049a4ed96f; 94399392528a2c6febf9aaf4764e56347467f9df; 88418375f69d5a5e05047e5ff49e1cb57b652d70; b8d8d5655f0bc852a0a2fc658a1ccad2f6388e13; 2c321a263754c8d5fdd4301b1c99f0d6fd354603; fd6d65a8e9eb04f3452f23300f6698e29bdbc3f3; d7a8cb038d1d8c272e992fe529aab0287276ec5b; 1131d8b881360ea83ed82ededb707b4a30f52ae2; 7d2d8bdcdafda11ae3d7e5af4ef0c1b3890b7dd5; 80bc2cd20a1d4f3339436f51e259f51ce0656468; c51d96ccbb7bc811353683a28b8d381686f3a45d; 72f1a846dec15996d416e58e5f69d5fb6d8104bc; 6e42beb368418e8eb83196afbdbb93cd66d3631f; 4c9fe260b99317b279598f869bb11267e401471e; d5be0087ec41009e8bc467bdf05cb5a2a7ac39de; cbd0bdf07be3f043866d8d52f9b327ad7572034c; ebae71f5025d9bda32594b5b8313dbae2a44893e; a7d4080e9639d5479f9f130d500e5f58ff39ab84; 6509535caa1fee422c2d382f7f8d25a3749775f2; 9a5fe059f2999e20bc953aa270149a87f5cc8cbf; fee50e93b551eb931dd99ee89079585df5505740; b18ba9dd5b20d1d29c1f623de9a872a4b00161c4; 9ffc5ed438c65c5a9522bac618bac440f782e058; d52e3493e43b2288b83c25bf56053e27ae6b08c6; d7697d61a5e9674fca90908a794c2967b576fac8; c8685da310adf1b3c55af193506d8d54a5d8e3ea; 80bad398d71589ee1850fc074263511ef0cb9998,a6f1dfcc44277d4cfd8507284d994c9283dc3a2f; 51f600e30708cf81b0ae91d1293859bc30e42b6a; 88a7498d16c2f47ea57c8418420e67d0ee40ad26; 265dc07d55d122256dbb7031acf48caa8e3992d2; 141a5951ad63fe598018b39a7067e22f83548146; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; 042295345732a972cc302784b675e10da19c72b8; 655dee46474502d4ee152c128241377164e91969; 1ae3404a2443c4bc72f9978e3c16a4d3a5c4d710; 30ddaec0e285ef8b256ef53b6ccec4d0384681d7; ce95e86cd169786d54cd3257b787b729b2ecaa01; c083eb83293da33e91b50d9b488df9dd434760fb; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; c5104f0e4ad289ecacf7b0bddf861741fbb9f5a9; ab326f18976b598b039f3d000d1001b39873150b; 255910019e3661154eef356e93124ddce2931a2b; 92d8a0238aaba7df1bcc1b55d8ca567272b88609; ab423fe8c991d0fbb4ec712e301d3b34bbae7ae9; 7d9f6108a05d471e964b6df7e6537c03427bde13; 9b095221ee4f50cb4ea27889541bc369b2e9d250; 5eea0be6547681a3c18603d028a83564cb10c5f1; 3c5cb8fec4eebb4b06219f043ad8eb269baf1e7a,NeuroImage,88,170-180
2c467c5fbbb53393640a318aacfc86961d3eca24,Selection of Ordinally Scaled Independent Variables,"Ordinal categorial variables are a common case in regression modeling. Although the case of ordinal response variables has been well investigated, less work has been done concerning ordinal predictors. This article deals with the selection of ordinally scaled independent variables in the classical linear model, where the ordinal structure is taken into account by use of a dierence penalty on adjacent dummy coecients. It is shown how the Group Lasso can be used for the selection of ordinal predictors, and an alternative blockwise Boosting procedure is proposed. Emphasis is placed on the application of the presented methods to the (Comprehensive) ICF Core Set for chronic widespread pain.",2009,Psychology,"list(name = ""Jan Gertheiss"", ids = ""2374911""); list(name = ""Sara Hogger"", ids = ""11627261""); list(name = ""Cornelia Oberhauser"", ids = ""5903426""); list(name = ""Gerhard Tutz"", ids = ""67049458"")",6c363404e75d760dfa97e002017ed61656713860; e3a24122e113dadedfa2b569be090a90995edf72; 771f5e9a1c2c88b2031e4c15b7454d8f30dae697; 85c234b89713884a2ad0c5a38f5a41e0dd768754; 01297918f44c3159ed50ae1874c759b31ccd8a82,10179d638070a2f2381f917aeb27768b76cbe3f2; ade03d0c772c35dc8e865bdb41d7bc54d5b782d1; 814cf172298d11db0ac9b839440ed8f3db93e438; 453f9a62347fda991ac985273d6cc8c88051b4e7; ce9456471bbf688ba992acf1f47146669d72593b; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 56721502ec32fb4783bb7e16105ca012af833a9d; 65e2852ee299b7855b0f8f8d45736b97fa55d1bb; 35702d642c5f1b7950d088497837486b4ca682a3; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 69b891d9738ee348da0a5d43b16bffd7bc7045e1; a54474b886de90f339ac8ce9703ba098fbb40a9b; e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 4ef4ecd55f28742cde8f2be361ec4ff74500d91c; 5a15547e1c09e0edb76fc08291403b36e8d289a6; f488ac84e3b5edeeac344a211ab9406e49edbfab; 7043830f13501cd147a9bba1c25152766123e0f6; 06cb0076e310136d0ca8b56cc8585ec2bf43e029; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; 3b58125190c2b79caef1606e18fea404dbfb62ce; 6f4493eff2531536a7aeb3fc11d62c30a8f487f6; 706247890d0d585262fa965efabf2089fe48d927; 68c1bfe375dde46777fe1ac8f3636fb651e3f0f8; 38cb6d96f16b4d77fa21836b8de96915b75cac5d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 83edc57c7fa36bec0c833faa620d312a472fabb6; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; 1a9a7e44fba2508accc0569c42a6b71f3f17b2c2; 072d09ba865b5c2cfac279696c555730f0cdbce4; 01297918f44c3159ed50ae1874c759b31ccd8a82; 44fd92c355684c4cf10fd4b49f89e7078333be43; bf1ee22af84f7fab614ce9a258d04165eec88f23; 54b3f0acc4792135c5e6960b592f9cf6ad518b18; fc674fe24fcefec2227ecc067cc2be550913f944; a92684c164b0c46020a371ae5116df74bb37a412; 176f00d2c38fbb32402fb3f564ba38d622eb0730; 8c8684b2322e5dca1d07f08578b82a0b38fd3a44; 74d9e83732ded08d6abb50d32d06e332b6eb11b8; 543b4b1d82ba1060b3f23cd9d1c4066ef764fffa; c11c786ac8fdf834df390e96a765ea8a15cb210f; a98284c7b5df8b198d64f67127c75e747155f348,,,

We apply the Lasso to a predictive linear regression model in a study with baseline and follow up measurement for unspecific low back pain with a focus on the selection of psycho sociological predictors. Practitioners want to report measures of 
uncertainty for estimated regression coefficients, i.e. p-values or confidence intervals, 
where post selection classical t-tests are not valid anymore. In the last few years 
several approaches for inference in high-dimensional data settings have been developed. 
We do a selective overview on assigning p-values to Lasso selected variables 
and analyse two methods in a simulation study using the structure of our data set. 
We found out that Multi Sample Splitting (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009) may not be helpful for generating p-values, while the LDPE approach of Zhang and Zhang (2014) produces promising results for type-I-errors and power calculations on single hypotheses.

fbe73cbdfbcdb74e734df2f5a374b943e2a0e7b4,Identification of Grouped Rare and Common Variants via Penalized Logistic Regression,"In spite of the success of genome-wide association studies in finding many common variants associated with disease, these variants seem to explain only a small proportion of the estimated heritability. Data collection has turned toward exome and whole genome sequencing, but it is well known that single marker methods frequently used for common variants have low power to detect rare variants associated with disease, even with very large sample sizes. In response, a variety of methods have been developed that attempt to cluster rare variants so that they may gather strength from one another under the premise that there may be multiple causal variants within a gene. Most of these methods group variants by gene or proximity, and test one gene or marker window at a time. We propose a penalized regression method (PeRC) that analyzes all genes at once, allowing grouping of all (rare and common) variants within a gene, along with subgrouping of the rare variants, thus borrowing strength from both rare and common variants within the same gene. The method can incorporate either a burden-based weighting of the rare variants or one in which the weights are data driven. In simulations, our method performs favorably when compared to many previously proposed approaches, including its predecessor, the sparse group lasso [Friedman etÂ al., 2010].",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristin L.

c2b2302d9e886eb02778bbc9e5d48d1d03a32692,Constrained Grouped Sparsity,"In this paper, we propose an algorithm encouraging group sparsity under some convex constraint. It stems from some applications where the regression coefficients are subject to constraints, for example nonnegativity and the explanatory variables are not suitable to be orthogonalized within groups. It takes the form of the group LASSO based on linear regression model where a L1/L2 norm is imposed on group coefficients to achieve group sparsity. It differs from the original group LASSO in the following ways. First, the regression coefficients must obey some convex constraints. Second, there is no requirement for orthogonality of the variables within individual groups. For these reasons, the simple blockwise coordinate descent for all group coefficients is no longer applicable and a special treatment for the constraint is necessary. The algorithm we proposed in this paper is an alternating direction method, and both exact and inexact solutions are provided. The inexact version simplifies the computation while retaining practical convergence. As an approximation to group L0, it can be applied to data analysis where group fitting is essential and the coefficients are constrained. It may serve as a screening procedure to reduce the number of the groups when the number of total groups is prohibitively high.",2012,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yi Guo"", ids = ""145058406""); list(name = ""Junbin Gao"", ids = ""1750488""); list(name = ""Xia Hong"", ids = ""1689945"")",9805675669774d5ff0193764c2807cf2af5af07d,,,,433-444

Gliomas can be classified into different histopathologic grades according to World Health Oraganization (WHO) grading system which represents malignancy. In this paper, we present a method to predict the grades of Gliomas using Radiomics imaging features. MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATs 2015) training data, its segmentation ground truth and the ground truth labels were used for this work. 45 radiomics features based on histogram, shape and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were extracted from each FLAIR, T1, T1-Contrast, T2 image to quantify the property of Gliomas. Significant features among 180 features were selected through L1-norm regularization (LASSO). Based on LASSO coefficient and selected feature values, we computed a LASSO score and gliomas were classified into low-grade glimoa (LGG) or high-grade glimoa (HGG) through logistic regression. Classification result was validated by a 10-fold cross validation. Our method achieved accuracy of 0.8981, sensitivity of 0.8889, specificity of 0.9074, and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8870.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hwan-Ho Cho"", ids = ""1460086530""); list(name = ""Hyunjin Park"", ids = ""114875073"")",4659a606b6d0e5e0f436f56aa31efde1556376c2; 1b79f993c807447f3cbc4009fab9f4582c968437; beade7bb19b28c8c317567a885573359d79b2ebe; 3fc93afbe44eebf8bc12459cfe4192a5d653559f; 22aab9009bc7c5fccb88b1ec93de27f02583cb95; 6e1aa17bbbf888a043a0973f4f6541073011ef3c,,Conference proceedings : ...

ad32538ca52a39d57c996a66edbc9f2bf5d011a6,Sparse regression and marginal testing using cluster prototypes.,"We propose a new approach for sparse regression and marginal testing, for data with correlated features. Our procedure first clusters the features, and then chooses as the cluster prototype the most informative feature in that cluster. Then we apply either sparse regression (lasso) or marginal significance testing to these prototypes. While this kind of strategy is not entirely new, a key feature of our proposal is its use of the post-selection inference theory of Taylor and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference for forward stepwise and least angle regression, Preprint, arXiv:1401.3889) and Lee and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference with the lasso, Preprint, arXiv:1311.6238v5) to compute exact [Formula: see text]-values and confidence intervals that properly account for the selection of prototypes. We also apply the recent ""knockoff"" idea of Barber and CandÃ¨s (2014, Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs, Preprint, arXiv:1404.5609) to provide exact finite sample control of the FDR of our regression procedure.

ea4518bd35f274dcf9e1081dd83c1ede0cdad8a1,A Predictive Model for Determining Patients Not Requiring Prolonged Hospital Length of Stay After Elective Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND
Hospital length of stay (LOS) is an important quality metric for total hip arthroplasty. Accurately predicting LOS is important to expectantly manage bed utilization and other hospital resources. We aimed to develop a predictive model for determining patients who do not require prolonged LOS.


METHODS
This was a retrospective single-institution study analyzing patients undergoing elective unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty from 2014 to 2016. The primary outcome of interest was LOS less than or equal to the expected duration, defined as â‰¤3 days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate a model for this outcome, and a point-based calculator was designed. The model was built on a training set, and performance was assessed on a validation set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were calculated to determine discriminatory ability and goodness-of-fit, respectively. Predictive models using other machine learning techniques (ridge regression, Lasso, and random forest) were created, and model performances were compared.


RESULTS
The point-based score calculator included 9 variables: age, opioid use, metabolic equivalents score, sex, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, obesity, and primary anesthesia type. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the calculator on the validation set was 0.735 (95% confidence interval, 0.675-0.787) and demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P = .37). When using a score of 12 as a threshold for predicting outcome, the positive predictive value was 86.1%.


CONCLUSIONS
A predictive model that can help identify patients at higher odds for not requiring a prolonged hospital LOS was developed and may aid hospital administrators in strategically planning bed availability to reduce both overcrowding and underutilization when coordinating with surgical volume.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rodney A.

In this setting, several estimators such as the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) and the Dantzig Selector (Candes and Tao, 2007) are known to satisfy interesting properties whenever the vector Î²âˆ— is sparse. Interestingly, both the LASSO and the Dantzig Selector can be seen as orthogonal projections of 0 into DC(s)={Î²âˆˆRp,â€–Xâ€²(Yâˆ’XÎ²)â€–âˆžâ‰¤s}, using an l1 distance for the Dantzig Selector and l2 for the LASSO. For a well chosen s>0, this set is actually a confidence region for Î²âˆ—. In this paper, we investigate the properties of estimators defined as projections on DC(s) using general distances. We prove that the obtained estimators satisfy oracle properties close to the one of the LASSO and the Dantzig Selector.

3cb22adb33a0fa2e92ecfdc9da1e661bfd2cd73e,Principal Component Regression by Principal Component Selection,"Abstract We propose a selection procedure of principal components in principal component regression. Our methodselects principal components using variable selection procedures instead of a small subset of major principalcomponents in principal component regression. Our procedure consists of two steps to improve estimation andprediction. First, we reduce the number of principal components using the conventional principal componentregression to yield the set of candidate principal components and then select principal components among thecandidate set using sparse regression techniques. The performance of our proposals is demonstrated numericallyand compared with the typical dimension reduction approaches (including principal component regression andpartial least square regression) using synthetic and real datasets.Keywords: Biased estimation, dimension reduction, penalized regression, principal componentregression, principal component selection. 1. Introduction Regression model is a popular statistical model for data analysis. Under fairly general conditions,the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the regression model has many desirable properties,including unbiasedness and minimum variance. Multicollinearity deteriorates OLS estimator quality.Multicollinearity often arises in many real-world applications where the set of explanatory variableshas the nearly linear dependence or the sample size is smaller than the variable size. Two types ofbias estimation are widely used to address such situation. One of them is regularization method,where model parameters are selected under a certain constraint. Popular regularization methods forregressionareridgeregression,Lasso,andotherpenalizedregressionmethods. Theotherisdimensionreductionmethods(suchasprincipalcomponentregression(PCR)andpartialleastsquaresregression(PLSR)) where explanatory variable space is decomposed into orthogonal directions and only someof them are used for model building. Both of approaches produce biased estimators, but often have asmaller variance than OLS estimators. This property (incurring bias and reducing variance) improvesestimation and prediction, and this is the reason why biased estimation methods are popular.

The introduction of a large number of individual random effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. To modify this inflation effect a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced to shrink the individual effects toward the common population values by using the Lasso and adaptive Lasso penalties in the quantile regression check function. A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions. The simulation studies and real data analysis indicate that the proposed methods generally perform better in comparison to the other approaches.,2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""A.

In recent years, several experimental studies have revealed that the microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum, plasma, exosome, and whole blood are dysregulated in various types of diseases, indicating that the circulating miRNAs may serve as potential noninvasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, no database has been constructed to integrate the large-scale circulating miRNA profiles, explore the functional pathways involved, and predict the potential biomarkers using feature selection between the disease conditions. Although there have been several studies attempting to generate a circulating miRNA database, they have not yet integrated the large-scale circulating miRNA profiles or provided the biomarker-selection function using machine learning methods.


Results
To fill this gap, we constructed the Circulating MicroRNA Expression Profiling (CMEP) database for integrating, analyzing, and visualizing the large-scale expression profiles of phenotype-specific circulating miRNAs. The CMEP database contains massive datasets that were manually curated from NCBI GEO and the exRNA Atlas, including 66 datasets, 228 subsets, and 10,419 samples. The CMEP provides the differential expression circulating miRNAs analysis and the KEGG functional pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, to provide the function of noninvasive biomarker discovery, we implemented several feature-selection methods, including ridge regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forests. Finally, we implemented a user-friendly web interface to improve the user experience and to visualize the data and results of CMEP.

As a result of that, the location of non-zeros elements in the sparse vector (s-vector) does not infer about the true class of the test vector unlike the sparse representation classification (SRC) over the exemplar dictionary. Thus, in our earlier works employing the learned dictionary for language recognition (LR), the s-vectors are required to be processed for classification. In this work, we explore SRC over discriminative learned dictionary for LR. For this purpose, the language-specific training i-vectors are used to create the language-specific learned dictionary. These language-specific dictionaries are then concatenated to form a composite discriminative dictionary. For sparse coding, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net (ENet) algorithms are explored. The regularized multiclass logistic regression is employed for score calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation data set in closed set condition on 30 seconds duration segments.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Om Prakash Singh"", ids = ""152850365""); list(name = ""Rohit Sinha"", ids = ""83888148"")",,a7d2eff1946c304562675dbce6743225731560f4; 71b0e39e6b59f3d1914c294e1d37cf75e6b73718; a2b439b063874df0a074449c7c8616ac0880c9c5; c734cd311322a204334328f51d906d7640b5fdde; 36cac502dd96788b7eef91bdef152d47b71bd1fb; 9067db319ecb338312070a92b081341e6f03a6c6; 9f3b93ce577d82cb5b0892ec96bc6f8bab868f43; 2a3b0601d60d673663253de4e8523adac2424675; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 999023f811eb503a5c5bc9cc7d967ea15dbdb7c2; 7177be81b6be82112a26e0633bb7aa899d6233f5; 0f7424c3c6ca48a7048a50f7fb11220c3a42155b; 3a84467dc8d17675c6297d94d1501bd3ed26f21f; 99382f7ac870469335b2e5e3a1c5ff8d48871712; 1c677c7837f88427f7dafcf8ad9bdb083bc9a947; 2071f3ee9ec4d17250b00626d55e47bf75ae2726; 0fa4e9278518c0433162868a2e3a753ae4e187e4; 44445803eb255772b8ba49e6c1d2fb7bc8001c2b; 1994776f85393d6c86399a80ec85eaa59e5265a2; d5eec41043d91964879c4c745c7165f823967f29; b14ceda6fd859da23f0e66712db3b23941b02a93; ccd1282aea3cc7c3d40300d82472fc5f9f54cb8e; 692472138baefd2ab6c83baf55841e682090bf23; d5d7b06f5ae405709c712c8b2aa5b3bd236dea1a; db8b2be021e81a36c038a31b9d4217706e4eae2b; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; c1944d4130b6f228bd729030d0fb5d44c1e24848; 30eb6b47b4774fff7d1999b1059148800de30cfd,TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference,,2632-2636
d288359cf8aad66a09e2cf486085254d478438f5,Better prediction by use of co-data: adaptive group-regularized ridge regression.,"For many high-dimensional studies, additional information on the variables, like (genomic) annotation or external p-values, is available. In the context of binary and continuous prediction, we develop a method for adaptive group-regularized (logistic) ridge regression, which makes structural use of such 'co-data'. Here, 'groups' refer to a partition of the variables according to the co-data. We derive empirical Bayes estimates of group-specific penalties, which possess several nice properties: (i) They are analytical. (ii) They adapt to the informativeness of the co-data for the data at hand. (iii) Only one global penalty parameter requires tuning by cross-validation. In addition, the method allows use of multiple types of co-data at little extra computational effort. We show that the group-specific penalties may lead to a larger distinction between 'near-zero' and relatively large regression parameters, which facilitates post hoc variable selection. The method, termed GRridge, is implemented in an easy-to-use R-package. It is demonstrated on two cancer genomics studies, which both concern the discrimination of precancerous cervical lesions from normal cervix tissues using methylation microarray data.

With the development of clinical genomics, genetic heterogeneity in tumors was found to be relevant to OSCC tumorigenesis in precision medicine studies. Over the past decade, global microarray expression profiling has been used to investigate biomarkers for human diseases. In this study, we proposed two computational strategies for identifying RNA biomarkers from microarray expression profiles of OSCC. Firstly, the logistic regression model with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization was used to analyze RNA expression profiles from OSCC tissues. Secondly, differential expression analysis for lncRNA profiles from both tumor and the corresponding para-cancerous tissues was performed to identify biomarkers related with lymph node metastasis, which might contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",2019,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Si Zheng"", ids = ""144683798""); list(name = ""Jiagen Li"", ids = ""8549624""); list(name = ""Li Hou"", ids = ""145779864""); list(name = ""Jiao Li"", ids = ""49298125"")",,,Studies in health technology and informatics,264,"

7eb8e6e0cbea7e47039810ff874f6efa7fac3389,Model selection in quantile regression models,"Lasso methods are regularisation and shrinkage methods widely used for subset selection and estimation in regression problems. From a Bayesian perspective, the Lasso-type estimate can be viewed as a Bayesian posterior mode when specifying independent Laplace prior distributions for the coefficients of independent variables [32]. A scale mixture of normal priors can also provide an adaptive regularisation method and represents an alternative model to the Bayesian Lasso-type model. In this paper, we assign a normal prior with mean zero and unknown variance for each quantile coefficient of independent variable. Then, a simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based computation technique is developed for quantile regression (QReg) models, including continuous, binary and left-censored outcomes. Based on the proposed prior, we propose a criterion for model selection in QReg models. The proposed criterion can be applied to classical least-squares, classical QReg, classical Tobit QReg and many others. For example, the proposed criterion can be applied to rq(), lm() and crq() which is available in an R package called Brq. Through simulation studies and analysis of a prostate cancer data set, we assess the performance of the proposed methods. The simulation studies and the prostate cancer data set analysis confirm that our methods perform well, compared with other approaches.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rahim Alhamzawi"", ids = ""3295721"")",9137924feaeea30699506ef52b4cd2d356a54819; a1954e36422820e92d23483aaf4452a883fc16c7; b4a212c98b0258587771c2388c91f88f02b4259d; a037ea5dd1bef7cc7ffb963383695e7b5ceeb402; 5569704da3c5bb2d06cb1cec5f5477e1e5c996e1; abc48ed7627c290a82d9e01e15a030e2452c8385; a67fae5bdb4373c1145af3b78ee84fbb7b1e1884,7975ffb9f8a3e8686b9f473770e352f2fbd97851; 4b39cb5f7dbefedb5208d389ca6413cc8b9fca1e; 93dae24361ee06a221566fd2e983cf8f833c62e5; b66706282474619a55d6bac46d16172256c0c954; 585b4192d1d0926b8ff0428666ea1bd5f64db4af; d0bbeeba01481b12a805bb2c23c2c462f7188ebb; 907ddcee37f050f0dd63ba157cefe92a148ab185; 4f673fdf5055cf50e1ad529eba68c83e7451407a; 5565df5479f0b470aa19389973e22e86fc8783b1; c90f8f6c020c10b0e97269477590eccfde4abfda; 4f559b77a54c32f6fd27769cc2614fb1daef081d; f6b851108e69e015a0cfd7dcac84d04286027c7b; eb6040037bbf3692d19ffdd93e29d6f8992b4788; 91417036889f743818d6b93b4e567bb59136d485; 437f575684733a09732b567d9ffbfd711ebf34b1; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e222e089d4e307b8ebd6dffda86c28839964e311; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 3c30cc3d7ce23705543aa06b82fa70d7df638717; f22be43d0b1383f83241bff572b8088f87428b50; de68633453cec5a4b9ae5282a44b77a22ea0c7ec; 7adbaea0b1987e3f4b8e39929f7057e1f03560d5; 7330366efb83b3daaa5d0773862d67917d8fef03; 765ad58b752522aff2062aa436c204590c6f2290; 7a0c4abb8249411a571aa02c37405e5f731341e7; 60b429f2d78fa232390045e9bc4d40ebf5ac9127; f0faa16d0b79e24137cf1d0b0541d2245d8ef125; e9e4914faa8326028693ec48bf91869540f965b4; 7494e1a43431fd5641f76275f8cb76304fd05586; 3b2cf908d7fb259888d51e75ea6433f8bc9a7371; 808d76783c14a12680031cd48b9220741d56559e; b71c3c5b9f7ee4d76b8558c2baedf3843d1d93c1; b68111d2e692bbc1e5708b9d0de346e9e12577d4; c74f3c797a2238d0a40fdce8dd201789bbc1242a; ef1adb6e3498dd9705e1173695e2e8bcf3d94f34; 61caaeca70d0261c482476a5f52abee5d15aec85; d9f1259fcc5691e65ab2ba07e8f2b679fb63863c; de53313b1d19c47e2fe2605952d4d5c95d2eb098; 80d99bba05b2c4b358cdb59c922483a50bab3c20; e1747742bd90749583c2ecba7ed03931f689a4bc; bca3bc3708a657cc6775a649ba5e31837ba836a6; c09db7439505f49a0958f68e782df94b3807341a; c73a0b1e368184f33fa94d119a96e923478e0684; 5b673e8359ddc74a58802d92e139a91d5b12c52b; a88c4014da492520eceff8b359d981d6ef4b8e5e,Journal of Applied Statistics,42,445 - 458
300fb3c37ecebcbb3b11d7264b5c3be70c184b45,Fast Identification of Biological Pathways Associated with a Quantitative Trait Using Group Lasso with Overlaps,"Where causal SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) tend to accumulate within biological pathways, the incorporation of prior pathways information into a statistical model is expected to increase the power to detect true associations in a genetic association study. Most existing pathways-based methods rely on marginal SNP statistics and do not fully exploit the dependence patterns among SNPs within pathways.We use a sparse regression model, with SNPs grouped into pathways, to identify causal pathways associated with a quantitative trait. Notable features of our Â“pathways group lasso with adaptive weightsÂ” (P-GLAW) algorithm include the incorporation of all pathways in a single regression model, an adaptive pathway weighting procedure that accounts for factors biasing pathway selection, and the use of a bootstrap sampling procedure for the ranking of important pathways. P-GLAW takes account of the presence of overlapping pathways and uses a novel combination of techniques to optimise model estimation, making it fast to run, even on whole genome datasets.In a comparison study with an alternative pathways method based on univariate SNP statistics, our method demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of important pathways, showing the greatest relative gains in performance where marginal SNP effect sizes are small.",2012,Mathematics; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matt Silver"", ids = ""48047275""); list(name = ""Giovanni Montana"", ids = ""1699650""); list(name = ""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative"", ids = ""1404490124"")",6fe2c91922f34e48ad13f102f533fe3d50787498; d16ca9a465e734761a09785e25f997af1fb70317; 795092e33ca73576c2e40e96a9b4979fa320918b; 2e0d0baa03903a7c922f20b8e3255de03c79adc7; bf9b283016f41e8a5e60e2e6919c4bcb7b8e2547; 530040634477f71bd0b546addbdd0ee6a0aeee5c; 155a28a918d1ac17d42aaf6f2c7058edaa5e75af; d110cff3309e21b277a94ea0620ea28b5da6579b; 2ab45df639440283bfa03b1bdd01c92db8e80a24; 9398423b713cd47bef72fb945c6d52d837f6aae2; bc20c8a03b38ac51d7179b92a96998b3fecba242; b62e1da521998ad211b089739ce1d318ea146892; c6ece96edad66502631a0c5573be6979e69bbfb1; d75cabe44b3c0cd73fcec344f97c1945dfbcae77; fc09650fd4faf8aec3e24595a7e6d2f71d9e4474; 1a5aaea4255fc883792851c7794395b81f695d1c; 440abc75f7403aee6a623a7bfebebc39c046ebfa; 8e010307ef2b7c9678aa8fe37f9a610429f02d13; d64d52f2a0094086fe9c50e93e3c31aa95cf6b7c; fbe73cbdfbcdb74e734df2f5a374b943e2a0e7b4; 3d02bf57a60b6d58f2dd29f932a399fc37f1d015; 5d30e4305261def5fa967835ba2a04f8f4580738; d79ce2d4a6bab742620f6a829faa630a874a90a4; b9fb6e94a3bb790e9890ac2a51c4128a3dd218d1; 8491372b4a346c9a3809ee907cf3287cc2c5c3e6; b6f25deab1ddea006a9e3c5c2facc6f2b793b280,5e3c9778500da38bd75e4497239d129c509f066c; 94f27063c807f603803613575743efc32cdbf28f; 5214b65ed56efffd97493a59114a772dfb54caf1; c640d986fe11384d469037156bf7b89b2af6c5d1; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; 02c388d43f619146ef64babb4c848190e83add1b; 2b55ab0bd3362d30fb9ad586b0e677c9d402735a; 2342874bd2bd3a8483e28b8b29bbc0799b956c0c; b26e3c4d1e467e7a4c94cd107b0d155dfedc4e4c; 6a79847d4ad7b5088aa7b041bc9eb229086d35c0; d69fcbe1d42cd028949b83902d0b8c1ba2e335dc; 9b5d3c3f704b110b61f6e3b88aa844c257ca2d90; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; 70b8f7cdaf651032d8eea5da756efb2d838ccc1b; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 565949a972d45ff78f810e1155f44dcfb002816c; 7ccef11554371e1560f0cdc8bd2b740ec6110df3; 5903301093c7e31d5050404b29ccad8414fc0d29; 752b9d7c05b398a342205d5e6636787f019dba30; 3448bc23b911ab7446d3384422cd4db8d6ddf111; a45f66ac4dd72182ea84d195466e8b285bbd5420; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 582bc5d5e5dc6dcb92e3665a34110ef886a115cc; ef5d2ccd31e1fea79a81e49ea4e7aa765c77e190; 6cd92ce3b6a45adcefe43c5dc49125146c0edb23; 90381d538e5751eaba07a8fa659cfa5fe21b92fd; ae811bbbd75b62017f1117d0ea8a04835fcb06e3; a1f2f49e54e112b2be322074dd78bba24e54bf59; 59a45558657e93aed40a2f5c73bbd50a8d76dda0; 8eb45d1341afb1fd7916d281e8defb12c752f9c6; b0a347cae0ee765f7ebfb750c257ad301e7d69eb; 4d1ce1c69fdf6fd2ba4ec81ce7f0a6df49c6eba9; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; b2d8a0dee043cc644c1432e956ecae9ca447f62e,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,11,1 - 43
b83b84e29a021ef49905639d3adb80beae8f4757,Bayesian adaptive lassos with non-convex penalization,"The lasso (Tibshirani,1996) has sparked interest in the use of penalization of 
the log-likelihood for variable selection, as well as shrinkage. Recently, there have 
been attempts to propose penalty functions which improve upon the Lassos properties 
for variable selection and prediction, such as SCAD (Fan and Li, 2001) and 
the Adaptive Lasso (Zou, 2006). We adopt the Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso 
as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the regression coefficients, which 
have been given independent, double exponential prior distributions. Generalizing 
this prior provides a family of adaptive lasso penalty functions, which includes the quasi-cauchy distribution (Johnstone and Silverman, 2005) as a special case. 
The properties of this approach are explored. We are particularly interested in the 
more variables than observations case of characteristic importance for data arising 
in chemometrics, genomics and proteomics - to name but three. Our methodology 
can give rise to multiple modes of the posterior distribution and we show how 
this may occur even with the convex lasso. These multiple modes do no more 
than reflect the indeterminacy of the model. We give fast algorithms and suggest 
a strategy of using a set of perfectly fitting random starting values to explore 
different regions of the parameter space with substantial posterior support. Simulations

7f1b4898c369412603dca4b2828bf208b10869b3,IRGS: an immune-related gene classifier for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis,"BACKGROUND
Tumour cells interfere with normal immune functions by affecting the expression of some immune-related genes, which play roles in the prognosis of cancer patients. In recent years, immunotherapy for tumours has been widely studied, but a practical prognostic model based on immune-related genes in lung adenocarcinoma comparable to existing model has not been established and reported.


METHODS
We first obtained publicly accessible lung adenocarcinoma RNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for differential gene expression analysis and then filtered immune-related genes based on the ImmPort database. By using the lasso algorithm and multivariate Cox Proportional-Hazards (CoxPH) regression analysis, we identified candidate genes for model development and validation. The robustness of the model was further examined by comparing the model with three established gene models.


RESULTS
Gene expression data from a total of 524 lung adenocarcinoma patients from TCGA were used for model development. We identified four biomarkers (MAP3K8, CCL20, VEGFC, and ANGPTL4) that could predict overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma (HRâ€‰=â€‰1.98, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.64, Pâ€‰=â€‰4.19e-06) and this model could be used as a classifier for the evaluation of low-risk and high-risk groups. This model was validated with independent microarray data and was highly comparable with previously reported gene expression signatures for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we identified a practical and robust four-gene prognostic model based on an immune gene dataset with cross-platform compatibility. This model has potential value in improving TNM staging for survival predictions in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Lundbeck A/S, Clinical Pharmacology, Valby, Denmark; 5University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Ageing, Copenhagen, Denmark Question: Will unsupervised modelling of sleep EOG and sleep EEG reveal sleep characteristica indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)? Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) data from 10 age-matched control subjects were used to develop an EOG sleep model and an EEG sleep model. The sleep models were applied on full-night PSG data from 24 additional control subjects, 26 patients with periodic leg movements (PLM), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 PD patients. Based on the data-driven sleep models, features reflecting sleep characteristics in the EEG and EOG activity were computed. The total amount of data was devided in a training dataset containing 16 subjects from each of the four groups, and a validation dataset containing the remaining subjects. The features derived were evaluated and the most discriminative ones between iRBD/PD (neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cases) and PLM/controls (motor, but non-NDD cases) were found by training a Lasso regularized Regression model using eight-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. Results: The best classification model included four features derived from the EEG data, and the NDD patients in the validation dataset could be classified with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 61.1%. The most discriminative features were found to be thresholded amounts and stability of EEG topics reflected to REM, N3 and N1/N2, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the amount of N3 and R and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep determined by a data-driven sleep model can be used as potentially early PD biomarkers. P1048 Increased amount of reported total sleep time during 24 hours is related to the severity of sleep disturbances in ischemic stroke patients A. Holm1, M. Vaelimaeki1, T.-M. Haula2, S. Leskelae2, E. Rauhala1 1Satakunta Central Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Pori, Finland; 2Satakunta Central Hospital, Neurology, Pori, Finland Question: Are self-reported short and long term sleep quality related to the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances (SRBD) in ischemic stroke patients? Methods: In this pilot study, 23 patients with acute first-time stroke, admitted to the stroke unit, underwent overnight polygraphy during the first 72 h after admission. Nasal airflow, respiratory movements, snoring sound, oxygenation level, and ECG were recorded. The incidence of SRBD before the stroke was studied with a questionnaire regarding their sleep three months prior the stroke. The reported quality of sleep during the treatment period in stroke unit was examined with the visual scale questionnaire containing five questions. The severity of stroke was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the ability to function with the Barthel Index. Results: Increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the increased amount of total sleep time during 24 hours (p=0.006). No association was found between AHI and the amount of sleep time during night. Also, no correlations between AHI and VAS questions were found. Increased AHI was related with lower Barthel Index (p=0.017) but not with NIHSS. Conclusions: SRBD as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common findings in patients after stroke. In our study, stroke patients with increased AHI reported increased amount of sleep time during 24 h but not during night time regarding three months pre-stroke, suggesting that they are napping. SRBD negatively affect to the functional outcome after stroke. In addition, SRBD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which in turn increases risk for stroke. It is suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of underlying SRBD improve both recovery from stroke in short term and reduce the risk of relapses in long term. Our preliminary results suggest that reported napping may be a marker for a potential SRBD in stroke patients. P1049 Non-REM sleep microstructures and phasic REM sleep events are associated with intracranial oxygenation changes measured with NIRS J. Toppila1, T. Naesi2, J. Virtanen2, T. Salmi1, R. Ilmoniemi2 1Helsinki University Hospital, Medical Imaging/Clin. Neurophys., Helsinki, Finland; 2Aalto University, BECS, Espoo, Finland Question: Disordered and fragmented sleep due to sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of cardioand cerebrovascular morbidity. Autonomic activation and repetitive hypoxia are examples of possible mechanisms mediating this risk. In addition to sleep apnea episodes, non-apneic disruptions in sleep continuity are associated with transitory intracranial hypoxia measured with nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Some of the K-complexes are triggered by non-waking external auditory stimuli. Phasic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and surges in systemic blood pressure. Are these sleep microstructural phenomena associated with changes in intracranial blood oxygenation? Methods: Six healthy volunteers were measured overnight with polysomnography and NIRS for extraand intracranial blood oxygenation changes. Sleep spindles, K-complexes, and bursts of eye movements in REM sleep were detected. Average temporal changes in oxyand deoxyhemoglobin triggered by these sleep events were measured. Results: K-complexes triggered short intracranial hemodynamic responses and spindels delayed and longer responses. During and after phasic events in REM sleep, there were transient changes in intracranial blood oxygenation. Conclusions: K-complexes are associated with transient hemodynamic changes in intracranial circulation, which can mediate harmful vascular effects during poor sleep due to noisy environments. Systemic blood pressure surges during phasic REM sleep are counteracted with vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia episodes during REM sleep. This could be associated with an increased risk of stroke during early mornings. P1050 Neurophysiological testing of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea showing peripheral nervous lesions E.

Cox Proportional Hazards model is used to classify the patients as dead or survival with the accuracy measured by Score 1â€”the minimum of sensitivity and positive predictivity-of 0.45, which is 1.5 times better than that of the baseline ICU scoring system. Meanwhile, Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) removes redundant variables and Regression analysis estimates the patientsâ€™ death time. The model excels in clinical prediction in terms of good classification, hybrid usage of data analysis, machine learning and signal processing for more insightful extraction of clinical features. Furthermore, the fast response time and heterogeneous multivariate diagnosis in multidimensional dataspace, including temporal changes of time-variant physiological measurements proposed a effective solution for real-time ICU monitoring system.

Lymph node stage prior to treatment is strongly related to disease progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies have investigated metabolic imaging features derived from pre-radiotherapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of metastatic hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). We hypothesized that these would provide complementary prognostic information to FDG-PET descriptors to only the primary tumor (tumor).


METHODS
Two independent cohorts of 262 and 50 node-positive NSCLC patients were used for model development and validation. Image features (i.e. Radiomics) including shape and size, first order statistics, texture, and intensity-volume histograms (IVH) (http://www.radiomics.io/) were evaluated by univariable Cox regression on the development cohort. Prognostic modeling was conducted with a 10-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), automatically selecting amongst FDG-PET-Radiomics descriptors from (1) tumor, (2) LNs or (3) both structures. Performance was assessed with the concordance-index. Development data are publicly available at www.cancerdata.org and Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.752153b).


RESULTS
Common SUV descriptors (maximum, peak, and mean) were significantly related to overall survival when extracted from LNs, as were LN volume and tumor load (summed tumor and LNs' volumes), though this was not true for either SUV metrics or tumor's volume. Feature selection exclusively from imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics, exhibited performances of (1) 0.53 -external 0.54, when derived from the tumor, (2) 0.62 -external 0.56 from LNs, and (3) 0.62 -external 0.59 from both structures, including at least one feature from each sub-category, except IVH.


CONCLUSION

277d2f82f8c2772d330672840a02f3b3f629e0a8,Identifying individual sleep apnea/hypoapnea epochs using smartphone-based pulse oximetry,"Sleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories, thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 and pulse rate variability [PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events. Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data (40%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing data (60%), used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 81%; the model provided a median accuracy of 74% sensitivity of 75%, and specificity of 73% when using a risk threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 73% However, the performance might decrease when analyzing subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.",2016,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ainara Garde"", ids = ""19191888""); list(name = ""Parastoo Dehkordi"", ids = ""144772543""); list(name = ""John Mark Ansermino"", ids = ""145682503""); list(name = ""Guy Albert Dumont"", ids = ""144307952"")",1c6720bc139eb19724aa2e2c9ea57bf1bbb9ba71,,Conference proceedings : ...

c1918bc5828fe1cc68eb0aec80ae31019c0cf93d,Interregional causal influences of brain metabolic activity reveal the spread of aging effects during normal aging,"During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Xin Di"", ids = ""144276672""); list(name = ""Marie Woelfer"", ids = ""35492436""); list(name = ""Mario Amend"", ids = ""31933043""); list(name = ""Hans F.

f0b3eac78b3d0c994af9c8b94829e3a3f611ad89,Contraction properties of shrinkage priors in logistic regression,"Abstract Bayesian shrinkage priors have received a lot of attention recently because of their efficiency in computation and accuracy in estimation and variable selection. In this paper, we study the contraction properties of shrinkage priors in a logistic regression model where the number of covariates is high. For a shrinkage prior distribution that is heavy-tailed and concentrated around zero with high probability such as the horseshoe prior, the Dirichletâ€“Laplace prior, and the normal-gamma prior with appropriate choices of hyper-parameters, estimates of the logistic regression coefficient are shown to asymptotically concentrate around the true sparse vector in the L 2 -sense. It is shown that the proposed contraction rate is comparable with the point mass prior that is studied in Atchade (2017). The simulation study under the logistic regression model verifies the theoretical results by showing that the horseshoe prior and the Dirichletâ€“Laplace prior perform like the point mass prior for the estimation, variable selection and prediction, and yield much better results than Bayesian lasso and the non-informative normal prior.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ran Wei"", ids = ""152140901""); list(name = ""Subhashis Ghosal"", ids = ""2291789"")",21c9c321ae18742da2f0197a938c0cf243d0ca61; 806b38fd138e4ea2bab7f6fb9dce3d1b2e788624; 1d6033559fa9014da2c6bc3ca4892bed376a2858; ce2e7d2b1b4deb8303e59e9216a0c409f6a517bb; b3cead4d4e28afad2e4aab064690f551d91f61a7; 777de46dd0127af73ca22394e6f14504956d5219,a7cf29d7958d690dcd780297e10d221b00185559; 9f5cd9f8a47a1e2b73a207454b183ad802b9d6e3; 16371329845aeddd3e5f5c8b45cd8d71629ff30c; bb7b95c39285c485afad2262157efeb5de5152a3; 77a3f0ef7b4b4649d50cebfb45e2fcd438a9480c; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 91da74f48a1525beddbedd6177f76ebf8ef12c39; 336961d0537b8adf02d3eed244589321013fd225; a786a54dcf18de88b0f3abdadaa031a97b69bab7; 8f2ba7e3045c72e440dca449eea566cb5c6e16af; 857cf16949b0233fc0ff441520c466fee5966169; 35407d9652fd78e4f783c2559f30bd7dd66051cd; 961e2156d523e3901c491cc2a1f65764c976fc44; c04279edafe6005dc39d6b8e72972a6f1b44ec50; 43db36fb9ddebf4da12f3cced72e8a9892fe3ddb; a68b91fc1b244b190364c68145752f1bc03ab01d; 1d7ca3c549b19ed51f41a6558ec15b1bf1dea839; 25f2370fca25053a1ca52829f45fbbb6143e5412; 6ba008f337dbb426882fe4a86acba9aaf1dfacb9; ca8f0cabd20cfe07d5479a6396109216347b6d16; 02aa36295c4306a9b4e62a02094cdc48d4aab6ac; b7134309fc923d0395edb6c6c7d6695c82f053fc; 3cd291aeca4b456afb4760fe43f327dba27a59ed; 6ae68b2427e3da6b90c71361365ab7e509e8ddb4; e54dd68e01b2e94bb44cf374c6c1e94f4f761eb4; b71c3c5b9f7ee4d76b8558c2baedf3843d1d93c1; 315eb50f7bea92e1f2d569e511e009e8e1ed3aa8; 51d88925443329a35e9afe25a4b9cdbc4fd8e04d; 85f7193feb966ab8092c7208871627373d986e59; edf6117a38afa73b211259c88e4e5539891f6c2c,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,207,215-229

32577bd3a17538247eea0f5c60a04ee73197f990,Alternative prior distributions for variable selection with very many more variables than observations,"The problem of variable selection in regression and the generalised linear model is addressed. 
We adopt a Bayesian approach with priors for the regression coefficients that are 
scale mixtures of normal distributions and embody a high prior probability of proximity to 
zero. By seeking modal estimates we generalise the lasso. Properties of the priors and their 
resultant posteriors are explored in the context of the linear and generalised linear model especially 
when there are more variables than observations. We develop EM algorithms that 
embrace the need to explore the multiple modes of the non log-concave posterior distributions. 
Finally we apply the technique to microarray data using a probit model to find the 
genetic predictors of osteo- versus rheumatoid arthritis.

a7d746f946b84d3bd2e7930f306c58d3ec15ac91,A Fuzzy-based Software Tool Used to Predict 110m Hurdles Results During the Annual Training Cycle,"This paper describes a fuzzy-based software tool for predicting results in the 110m hurdles. The predictive models were built on using 40 annual training cycles completed by 18 athletes. These models include: ordinary least squares regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression, elastic net regression and nonlinear fuzzy correction of least squares regression. In order to compare them, and choose the best model, leave-one-out cross-validation was used. This showed that the fuzzy corrector proposed in this paper has the lowest prediction error. The developed software can support a coach in planning an athleteâ€™s annual training cycle. It allows the athleteâ€™s results to be predicted, and in this way, for the best training loads to be selected. The tool is a web-based interactive application that can be run from a computer or a mobile device. The whole system was implemented using the R programming language with additional packages.",2016,Engineering; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Krzysztof Przednowek"", ids = ""2940415""); list(name = ""Krzysztof Wiktorowicz"", ids = ""49808784""); list(name = ""Tomasz Krzeszowski"", ids = ""1761090""); list(name = ""Janusz Iskra"", ids = ""3933507"")",0e95f4577a7ed5c0d5bc05c0216ae374ef86af6f,103ec50bfc39640e74dac1af8010ca2a6d1aca72; 30fffa1bfde87f39206d0d5780aa22ff4be3ccc1; 9771c64a5652df97bdc1d11df692ec933409a6f9; a30d96d6d4df51d0b67524ce312173960d00658d; 7f3347a3b9b0d26a273e70d8b4ab3af1a57b706d; cfd8441b7897aead09bb926c563786c8c86eff91; ecff688de2497290d1f9c1474f0bb6bdb61c64c0; cda9a73bd15c1b44c1cf5844006ec77104fbfca6; 17d00ec9a7537004ee83cce5baa57c4d6f1b808c; 0ca9c9be647a34a30eda4fbde993e10cf45f92ed; 5d601de3315a5380ca09d3ef3a6510c37e8c0c75; 4041891dd8b7d133aaf6a685dc5c95690bcf7ea0; 7a6ad3979b0baa876eea2df7bc15130f7773cecf; 37767ab1f559dda7a8d239aec0af1c9485d3d426; 2a2609687dd2100d4a99986223560b1d0118f9d3; c0036e999bc4fd36ef9e6e4dcffbf7fe17fd47d5; 92af8f9aebbfb13e2279289c18e8cc3a75dc7606,,,176-181
35f869eb00f1be7566822c1f8e0f3d0542aa159d,Factors associated with physiciansâ€™ prescriptions for rheumatoid arthritis drugs not filled by patients,"BackgroundThis study estimated the extent and predictors of primary nonadherence (i.e., prescriptions made by physicians but not initiated by patients) to methotrexate and to biologics or tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who were newly prescribed these medications.MethodsUsing administrative claims linked with electronic health records (EHRs) from multiple healthcare provider organizations in the USA, RA patients who received a new prescription for methotrexate or biologics/tofacitinib were identified from EHRs. Claims data were used to ascertain filling or administration status. A logistic regression model for predicting primary nonadherence was developed and tested in training and test samples. Predictors were selected based on clinical judgment and LASSO logistic regression.ResultsA total of 36.8% of patients newly prescribed methotrexate failed to initiate methotrexate within 2Â months; 40.6% of patients newly prescribed biologics/tofacitinib failed to initiate within 3Â months. Factors associated with methotrexate primary nonadherence included age, race, region, body mass index, count of active drug ingredients, and certain previously diagnosed and treated conditions at baseline. Factors associated with biologics/tofacitinib primary nonadherence included age, insurance, and certain previously treated conditions at baseline. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the logistic regression model estimated in the training sample and applied to the independent test sample was 0.86 and 0.78 for predicting primary nonadherence to methotrexate and to biologics/tofacitinib, respectively.ConclusionsThis study confirmed that failure to initiate new prescriptions for methotrexate and biologics/tofacitinib was common in RA patients. It is feasible to predict patients at high risk of primary nonadherence to methotrexate and to biologics/tofacitinib and to target such patients for early interventions to promote adherence.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hong J.

4dddd35cfed9b2cc6fb381a3ae49997afa848968,Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Methods with Distinct Features to Estimate Battery SOC,"As the world is moving towards using renewable energy sources for a greener environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) has become an important issue because of the intermittent nature of renewable sources. The quantity associated with the amount of energy stored in battery at a certain time is called the batteryâ€™s State of Charge or SOC. Typically it is estimated with the assumption that it changes linearly with the quantities such as voltage, current etc. which can be measured effortlessly. But actually no such linear relationship exists. Machine learning techniques have proven to be useful for measuring SOC. Though the features that are conventionally used often suffer from a phenomenon called multicollinearity. Ridge and lasso regression methods have shown to counter the effects of multicollinearity. In this paper, these methods have been used along with linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Besides readily available conventional features some nonconventional features are explored too that can be derived from conventional features.

4dbf5f918a9a2949d4c74868bb8fe68a8d653836,Adaptive Robust Variable Selection.,"Heavy-tailed high-dimensional data are commonly encountered in various scientific fields and pose great challenges to modern statistical analysis. A natural procedure to address this problem is to use penalized quantile regression with weighted L1-penalty, called weighted robust Lasso (WR-Lasso), in which weights are introduced to ameliorate the bias problem induced by the L1-penalty. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, we investigate the model selection oracle property and establish the asymptotic normality of the WR-Lasso. We show that only mild conditions on the model error distribution are needed. Our theoretical results also reveal that adaptive choice of the weight vector is essential for the WR-Lasso to enjoy these nice asymptotic properties. To make the WR-Lasso practically feasible, we propose a two-step procedure, called adaptive robust Lasso (AR-Lasso), in which the weight vector in the second step is constructed based on the L1-penalized quantile regression estimate from the first step. This two-step procedure is justified theoretically to possess the oracle property and the asymptotic normality. Numerical studies demonstrate the favorable finite-sample performance of the AR-Lasso.",2014,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jianqing Fan"", ids = ""144958605""); list(name = ""YingYing Fan"", ids = ""2193729""); list(name = ""Emre Barut"", ids = ""34974515"")",648731b94e89ef2a3d60350519658bf202b05f70; a07dbdfe08d4c74fa2236a9232768008e9ba04f8; ec8385a4bd6576a9aed14e3db86a53d0b5674981; 71d7233f4e490dcd1e221cf0d4b7584a6806b6b2; 4dde02880a0b40498734c6171bc5920311966fac; f188091cca993efeeb7d33589d50666096fe7ad9; a44a32cb8eae3e043c5604bbed6be44713421582; 9138182644dd05a9d84d772cb29c463ac9a9e9a3; 132daa9be756ce5ac7caa4d43847f63bc36d2124; b326f0bba171339350924440e3d8338e0467e6c8; eca1661e5e256197a721f8d5b92eb1360eab8157; a4a4f5f4b7e7321bf824ab27354efede12b292e3; 1e20a56a50eae790bf40a707379a2e95d94c87b0; 33f8376a06fe64ba7c8503f8b83e6a6d1325855e; a2ece6de3c6d8dd795a52b21a34370c6044d861b; 630ab12a7f0a583c492ef6da059e0f333259c690; ccc814e63ff4179dcac185a67bba77acedb210f6; 186cfd9fe0a473aea0595dba7853c6a23de5e36f; 1c79c019b1a64318d50344f2f79769548a21ef10; 0e73fe32eed639c162f8d49209d923146b85fc94; e8d3989350dfb41c1d92a57f2a3c526692f6f317; 0680f3342fe166d6d4a5871995c861afc93ef821; e7041d24d44e06baacfb8fb19ee57a0227aab1ed; bb54948c1f8c841934b608fafab06769f1e0ee12; e0913e6456a593fb32f9093def23acc0a2c3356c; 73ea2facd78c7d09c3ee16adf11613eafba9a1a2; ef438d93a852ba818da1f51f243abe8e8e4e291f; 931eeb2e10de67dfe0d364a066d03f5059b18cd9; 9b8e2fa4e104cbe0c270eb0d01d7d06e2d479493; 809736f19a64da2f047792c1a2305292617f7406; 3de902692886e5d22ada12eaab43a6cb5109d1e8; be0f7b68eb9a5a4f89b669409dca41f7c4ef8cf0; 9e5f12b52aa361ec5e9405fcaaa2bf4d3fd3aa00; 0da6da1be8d1f0aaf24d748c0f7d17c99ca42ce1; f53fc01a1c1bcb2901fc7383ecd6775e8025bd3b; 816ad42cc13f2160fd0c3b29eee324b75c7e90d1; 5d0c42968efbe5c8088313fa40f280efb47c7eb1; b0fa3b02bdd7271586ccdafd873edcd6e67e343b; 10f8337899d68aa125e87ef24b878b532d60c850; 2426fcf797ebfcd5bf5a778b7bc27d5daeb16ecc; 6ec8eeb2d07963a351f1f059be593bd645427266; cc6bc625914752feff148fefc741ccd93dda54cd; ed87330a40384940ed52cb5df590fcc3e9f4bd70; 30dfcf488c26fc192184c4adfca495a0f952df52; 286b9a0ec0bee8800296bc3173bee4694081d748; d598c72cb606a6d5a77f20c0fa5d1371257e3b83; bc90e5fec41095494eccb8adbb0582f175940a94; 180b0ab8984c7b2367d682384916eb0468789f6d; 0faf38907adf856333f1fec2f554fac55791e35d; 8f7962b2c02ce659e6aa8badd1bbd0237c47d09b,500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; e56ad08d3e68898109636bbbaf1cd01975be7d39; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; baaf17f43fe6890d8529820e305403ffe22d295f; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; b68111d2e692bbc1e5708b9d0de346e9e12577d4; b98054f4a8582af49c77e53fcd9e68328ce7c01e; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 0bfd57b42c4620d3f51d0c75a3919eb9c7b73e83; c4fda00b0abee9b9a18383fcaa36bdcc19d9e39d; 80d99bba05b2c4b358cdb59c922483a50bab3c20; 819562c634d2d4e1369249e94086da8626e75f56; 5e3c9778500da38bd75e4497239d129c509f066c; 91edd8739dd4f871c8b216da212ac1f7a02e2e34; 6ca19a7ba29e421ffb130ecf3d66230fff570ee5; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; baa88620816472576822a08564399df5a77818a0; 5565df5479f0b470aa19389973e22e86fc8783b1; 3e1c7f27763c6400010d81074df87c0e2ccdf83f; c6ceb130f0010c82abcf97f4aa988642a67c903d; 3b189ffb16e05c2d51dc783d17cf2a24a27c2e4c; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; ceffcdae65f3ac3aa20df41d238551d54b1ea58a,Annals of statistics,42 1,"
