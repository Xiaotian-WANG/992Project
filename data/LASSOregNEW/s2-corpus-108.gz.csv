5e92fd6e09dddd0b11584d9ad37a922e63d05c81,An adapted geographically weighted LASSO (Ada-GWL) model for predicting subway ridership,"Ridership prediction at station level plays a critical role in subway transportation planning. Among various existing ridership prediction methods, direct demand model has been recognized as an effective approach. However, direct demand models including geographically weighted regression (GWR) have rarely been studied for local model selection in ridership prediction. In practice, acquiring insights into subway ridership under multiple influencing factors from a local perspective is important for passenger flow management and transportation planning operations adapting to local conditions. In this study, we propose an adapted geographically weighted LASSO (Ada-GWL) framework for modelling subway ridership, which involves regression-coefficient shrinkage and local model selection. It takes subway network layout into account and adopts network-based distance metric instead of Euclidean-based distance metric, making it so-called adapted to the context of subway networks. The real-world case of Shenzhen Metro is used to elaborate our proposed model. The results show that the proposed Ada-GWL model performs the best compared with the global model (ordinary least square, GWR, GWR calibrated with network-based distance metric and geographically weighted LASSO (GWL) in terms of estimation error and goodness-of-fit. Through understanding the variation of each coefficient across space (elasticities) and variables selection of each station, it provides more realistic conclusions based on local analysis. Besides, through clustering analysis of the stations according to the regression coefficients, clustersâ€™ functional characteristics are found to be in compliance with the policy of functional land use in Shenzhen, indicating the high interpretability of Ada-GWL model from the spatial angle. In other words, the regression coefficients of different stations can provide us the local prospective to understand the influence of factors on stationsâ€™ ridership.",2020,Economics,"list(name = ""Yuxin He"", ids = ""49990787""); list(name = ""Yang Zhao"", ids = ""51325581""); list(name = ""Kwok-Leung Tsui"", ids = ""33572028"")",,,Transportation,,1-32

Ulcerative colitis (UC) carries an increased risk of primary and recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection (rCDI), and CDI is associated with UC flares. We hypothesized that specific fecal microbial changes associate with UC flare and rCDI.


METHODS
We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 57 patients with UC and CDI, CDI only, and UC only. Stool samples were collected at baseline, at the end of antibiotic therapy, and after reconstitution for 16S rRNA sequencing. The primary outcomes were recurrent UC flare and rCDI. Logistic regression and Lasso models were constructed for analysis.


RESULTS
There were 21 (45.7%) patients with rCDI, whereas 11 (34.4%) developed UC flare. Patients with rCDI demonstrated significant interindividual (Pâ€…=â€…0.008) and intraindividual differences (Pâ€…=â€…0.004) in community structure by Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) compared with non-rCDI. Two cross-validated Lasso regression models predicted risk of rCDI: a baseline model with female gender, hospitalization for UC in the past year, increased Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobia, and decreased Eubacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonellaceae (AuROC,â€…0.94); and a model 14 days after completion of antibiotics with female gender, increased Shannon diversity, Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased community richness and Faecalibacterium (AuROC,â€…0.9). Adding JSD between baseline and post-treatment samples to the latter model improved fit (AuROC,â€…0.94). A baseline model including UC hospitalization in the past year and increased Bacteroidetes was associated with increased risk for UC flare (AuROC,â€…0.88).


CONCLUSION
Fecal microbial features at baseline and after therapy predict rCDI risk in patients with and without UC. These results may help risk stratify patients to guide management.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Allen Lee"", ids = ""3031589""); list(name = ""Krishna Rao"", ids = ""1390955367""); list(name = ""Julajak Limsrivilai"", ids = ""3645592""); list(name = ""Merritt G Gillilland"", ids = ""8840134""); list(name = ""Benjamin J.

By using a data-driven machine learning approach, the process is simplified considerably from the conventional analytical method. Regressor selection using the Lasso (l1-norm penalized least squares regression) is used. The method is explained with a simple example of a two-link direct-drive robot. Further demonstration is given by applying the method to a three-link belt-driven robot.

In order to address the heterogeneity of community healthcare in the US, k-Means clustering was performed on the CHDI dataset to determine community subtypes in terms of health challenges and outcomes. The optimal number of eight clusters was determined by the Elbow Method, and clusters were analyzed to determine significant differences in demographic. In order to determine community-specific healthcare solutions and directions, feature selection and modeling of healthcare outcomes was performed for each of the eight subtypes using LASSO regression. It was determined that different features significantly impact health outcomes in the different clusters, providing information about the unique health challenges faced by these different types of communities. LASSO regression using the entire unclustered dataset yielded significantly poorer results on the sub-clusters in terms of model performance, further supporting the claim that modeling community-specific needs is a vital step for delivering accurate and adequate community healthcare.

725501552a6544ef69d9eff2e7c07c9db7bd81ec,Nomogram for Predicting Cardiovascular Mortality in Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: An Observational Study,"Cardiovascular mortality risk is high for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients but it varies considerably among individuals. There is no clinical tool to predict cardiovascular mortality for PD patients yet. Therefore, we developed a cardiovascular mortality risk nomogram in a PD patient cohort. We derived and internally validated the nomogram in incident adult PD patients randomly assigned to a training (Nâ€‰=â€‰918) or a validation (Nâ€‰=â€‰460) dataset. The nomogram was built using the LASSO Cox regression model. Increasing age, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were consistent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Low hemoglobin and serum albumin, high hypersensitive C-reactive protein and decreasing 24â€‰hours urine output were identified as non-traditional cardiovascular risk predictors. In the validation dataset, the above nomogram performed good discrimination (1 year c-statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.83; 3 year c-statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.78) and calibration. This tool can classify patients between those at high risk of cardiovascular mortality (high-risk group) and those of low risk (low-risk group). Cardiovascular mortality was significantly different in the internal validation set of patients for the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (HR 3.77, 2.14â€“6.64; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

2b8d09a681c1b1069029dd9ab94c765eaa1ade15,Integrative Gene Expression Profiling Analysis to Investigate Potential Prognostic Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND Despite noteworthy advancements in the multidisciplinary treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) and deeper understanding in the molecular mechanisms of CRC, many of CRC patients with histologically identical tumors present different treatment response and prognosis. Thus, more evidence on novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers for CRC remains urgently needed. This study aims to identify potential prognostic biomarkers for CRC with integrative gene expression profiling analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Differential expression analysis of paired CRC and adjacent normal tissue samples in 6 microarray datasets was independently performed, and the 6 datasets were integrated by the robust rank aggregation method to detect consistent differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Aberrant expression patterns of these genes were further validated in RNA sequencing data. Then, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate significantly dysregulated biological functions in CRC. Finally, univariate, LASSO and multivariate Cox regression models were built to identify key prognostic genes in CRC patients. RESULTS A total of 990 DEGs (495 downregulated and 495 upregulated genes) were acquired after integratedly analyzing the 6 microarray datasets, and 4131 DEGs (2050 downregulated and 2081 upregulated genes) were obtained from the RNA sequencing dataset. Subsequently, these DEGs were intersected and 885 consistent DEGs were finally identified, including 458 downregulated and 427 upregulated genes. Two risky prognostic genes (TIMP1 and LZTS3) and 5 protective prognostic genes (AXIN2, CXCL1, ITLN1, CPT2 and CLDN23) were identified, which were significantly associated with the prognosis of CRC. CONCLUSIONS The 7 genes that we identified would provide more evidence for further applying novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in clinical practice to facilitate personalized treatment of CRC.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinkui Liu"", ids = ""48033054""); list(name = ""Zhitong Bing"", ids = ""122298860""); list(name = ""Jiarui Wu"", ids = ""65833964""); list(name = ""Jingyuan Zhang"", ids = ""50561384""); list(name = ""Wei Zhou"", ids = ""89163532""); list(name = ""Mengwei Ni"", ids = ""49155631""); list(name = ""Ziqi Meng"", ids = ""12209120""); list(name = ""Shuyu Liu"", ids = ""50152167""); list(name = ""Jinhui Tian"", ids = ""5949703""); list(name = ""Xiaomeng Zhang"", ids = ""47957462""); list(name = ""Yingfei Li"", ids = ""7770460""); list(name = ""Shanshan Jia"", ids = ""46633337""); list(name = ""Siyu Guo"", ids = ""1387915439"")",,c3b46d3c1f99d77a3051a42fec0a6b71073dc42c; 260d9595300a53362b18b277b42baaf8a0858ed4; 1e993b318e6b663ebc8822c9a3a2f59067bbef05; 3820168eb463150b3abb31556a3bfb14f5ee12fe; c59eb410300dfcffd976ca83f0c3fd99d8247c6a; aba73f6957bce1648f066935f7ea85a99119be5d; cff7513fc8973a3524b8920ecf644a442a4c62b2; 83ab5cf89399bca5449f4a7baf1b1b3c2e1178c7; b35dc0bf1f7b3d348360eb86c48421544047c4d6; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 4b1054f633ff312eb4ee142b5150dd748145260e; 0e29622c6a9a0315c75985795b539118ba51c4ba; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; b0b4388f6c90985ea2f2ba512596491ba52698a1; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; ca097155934e8eed360295d21e44cafb0c0d38ec; 2d76664c752551dfa3a9c70e10b00d9884df91da; 2de507c409e230848a2bfc470a025f779dbb184b; 64885cd032f72592b9a11bc3476c6496c50efd65; 0e5a571e3ea25c9e252218f2c767dbb4c2116bef; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; ddef5c2de1d77d0708a31c787d4b3c4fa073d819; 235ebc4868a99f5f23dd9d6feef07bbfe8a4ed73; 02db14f7fd3974c1ef2f414e6d71d73e5a873620; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 7d66db10695c406aaeba4f430732c0734bee7217; d04ae2fa4b584241f9166368cb2d46c3511aa80c; e59a598d67e6b1e061f7a209e1a837dc76396f20; 34dd21fd86c337642de88334b7e696d94f057833; cea31b10645107419ffd20adf9b083e13349d10c; 4a55d0a52edecee8745f9d9b74f0c25ec2aa97f4; 101d42d1ee9551be831e9f196387e80e4df0d87c; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 412b17b0300a712ccfad5b2f608eae837c9386c5; 939d05191d132bb1d2bec0dbe41f23df5b728d81; f44135d951fd87faeee70c1507ead99072ee3b14; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 30dbaa7955ac7d06d9ee59026db9ab3edecfcf2d; 59f5a4dcfaae8d80aa25e9f1007b32b6c63e5b3e; 238c4662070918f17edb8683453467a61491fec8; 3e62a4ca70771b8c737ff8f753198ecaa9670840; 3640a57947cfa8cb6abbd8281dc02547db5a6829; 52fc113a2b3d9b61994f6a6eeaad97e72de0804c; 93e799d7f31e7b35cd88c28b875a9398724b8d8c; 513926a324baa108a8c5f87fabacc510f9e40ba2; 56321e765211d85a29621551d0df9a1cfc0a78ca; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; a0c9bd0764e2fccbdddc80b8b96d426d88c59b44; a930659969b479b4ce557799daee811a65502e5f; 6443752261acf6f0003d5961da6bcc2e4898b788; 053b8b59288ed25606da79897358cec3a4cc7232; f1d394561df9eec2172508ce25bd1c134db251ff; 7a66381e700931bdb061a22ed87282a16a2097a4; 5365c256dc7739b4b7318a9434d63d8411fefffc; 0474d13db9033d0f6584c88a8bcc6511707a17f6; 93f9398690d9fa668f490c52486493a0286ff67d; 19847f2a40217d97b2fc6973a1f55894bdb005b3; 135e8fded0339984d2ea1dff206fae48dd10351f; 93ab6a670c02cc7e6d8182807cc53d9d6ddffcc0; f4b43fe9e8ad8f7815e01a4f2542520c381b912f; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; cb22aa3d64f8dfc5fa61cf35a9a6bb216f7007b4; 0f9b363dcb791f40d7fc9a5e4c72df8b29586073; 4c3b3e50240ba8bb7f3cb46f32529e9b8a42e220; d2557377ce8da5368b24ec2a8e2d88d53801c8dc; 7fd12a24d6d4106b96c26f28612e78b3e27ce10a; c7d30d2d92656056dff28a8653c8227b8b36284d; f92eb78ace9d1fd4aa990661a682d433167b69ac; 6dfd6d4b93e78e0daabee8aba9ab4af589e03428; fe7c92076d6e7e3c47ef70793b273d30a065ae79; c5ba6e3ac0968bc39924928cc8f5d5cebdba88ed; 74397d88e0adf93f5832b1d32dcc189ea4134003; a1907747d2382c0ec4ed9bc1eeb6d2e0f455bfd0; 53e970d9e22bd454036c53eb569c0c733cafbd59; 8758ab37c71c9f91d34b192cae53d9c5433b9f44,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research,26,e918906-1 - e918906-14
285f16ef8364595f01f1fe6d485cf85081ee3ec2,Predictive ability of genome-assisted statistical models under various forms of gene action,"Recent work has suggested that the performance of prediction models for complex traits may depend on the architecture of the target traits. Here we compared several prediction models with respect to their ability of predicting phenotypes under various statistical architectures of gene action: (1) purely additive, (2) additive and dominance, (3) additive, dominance, and two-locus epistasis, and (4) purely epistatic settings. Simulation and a real chicken dataset were used. Fourteen prediction models were compared: BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, elastic net, genomic best linear unbiased prediction, a Gaussian process, LASSO, random forests, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression, ridge regression (best linear unbiased prediction), relevance vector machines, and support vector machines. When the trait was under additive gene action, the parametric prediction models outperformed non-parametric ones. Conversely, when the trait was under epistatic gene action, the non-parametric prediction models provided more accurate predictions. Thus, prediction models must be selected according to the most probably underlying architecture of traits. In the chicken dataset examined, most models had similar prediction performance. Our results corroborate the view that there is no universally best prediction models, and that the development of robust prediction models is an important research objective.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mehdi Momen"", ids = ""39947167""); list(name = ""Ahmad Ayatollahi Mehrgardi"", ids = ""8836733""); list(name = ""Ayyub Sheikhi"", ids = ""47918465""); list(name = ""Andreas Kranis"", ids = ""6969803""); list(name = ""Llibertat Tusell"", ids = ""46732734""); list(name = ""Gota Morota"", ids = ""2166592""); list(name = ""Guilherme J.

0b09091c22d38d1029f6a45cee7da0fcb3ba2845,Metabolomics based markers predict type 2 diabetes in a 14-year follow-up study,"BackgroundThe growing field of metabolomics has opened up new opportunities for prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) going beyond the classical biochemistry assays.ObjectivesWe aimed to identify markers from different pathways which represent early metabolic changes and test their predictive performance for T2D, as compared to the performance of traditional risk factors (TRF).MethodsWe analyzed 2776 participants from the Erasmus Rucphen Family study from which 1571 disease free individuals were followed up to 14-years. The targeted metabolomics measurements at baseline were performed by three different platforms using either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. We selected 24 T2D markers by using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection operator (LASSO) regression and tested their association to incidence of disease during follow-up.ResultsThe 24 markers i.e. high-density, low-density and very low-density lipoprotein sub-fractions, certain triglycerides, amino acids, and small intermediate compounds predicted future T2D with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81. The performance of the metabolic markers compared to glucose was significantly higher among the young (ageâ€‰<â€‰50 years) (0.86 vs. 0.77, p-value <0.0001), the female (0.88 vs. 0.84, p-value =0.009), and the lean (BMIâ€‰<â€‰25Â kg/m2) (0.85 vs. 0.80, p-value =0.003).

The purpose of the present study was to identify a lncRNA-based nomogram that can predict BCR of PCa accurately. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis, such as propensity score matching (PSM) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were used to identify candidate lncRNAs for further bioinformatics analysis. LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most significant prognostic lncRNAs and construct the lncRNAs signature for predicting BCR in discovery set. Additionally, a nomogram based on our lncRNAs signature was also formulated. Both lncRNAs signature and nomogram were validated in test set. GSEA was carried out to identify various lncRNAs sets which share a common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. RESULTS: A total of 457 patients with sufficient BCR information were included in our analysis. Finally, a five lncRNAs signature significantly associated with BCR was identified in discovery set (HR=0.44, 95%CI: 0.27-0.72, C-index = 0.63) and validated in test set (HR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.09-0.56, C-index = 0.65). Additionally, the lncRNAs-based nomogram showed significant performance for predicting BCR in both discovery set (C-index = 0.74) and test set (C-index = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our lncRNAs-based nomogram is a reliable prognostic tool for BCR in PCa patients. In addition, the present study put forward the direction for the further investigation on the mechanism of PCa progression. Figure. No caption available. Figure. No caption available.

147c1650ad830ad354510469e6d00adf598c9abe,Identification of a m6A RNA methylation regulators-based signature for predicting the prognosis of clear cell renal carcinoma,"The mortality rate of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains high. The aim of this study was to identify novel prognostic biomarkers by using m6A RNA methylation regulators capable of improving the risk-stratification criteria of survival for ccRCC patients. The gene expression data of 16 m6A methylation regulators and its relevant clinical information were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression pattern of these m6A methylation regulators were evaluated. Consensus clustering analysis was conducted to identify clusters of ccRCC patients with different prognosis. Univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to construct multiple-gene risk signature. A survival analysis was carried out to determine the independent prognostic significance of the signature. Five m6A-related genes (ZC3H13, METTL14, YTHDF2, YTHDF3 and HNRNPA2B1) showed significantly downregulated in tumor tissue, while seven regulators (YTHDC2, FTO, WTAP, METTL3, ALKBH5, RBM15 and KIAA1429) was remarkably upregulated in ccRCC. Consensus clustering analysis identified two clusters of ccRCC with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and tumor stage between them. We also constructed a two-gene signature, METTL3 and METTL14, serving as an independent prognostic indicator for distinguishing ccRCC patients with different prognosis both in training, validation and our own clinical datasets. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve indicated the area under the curve (AUC) in these three datasets were 0.721, 0.684 and 0.828, respectively, demonstrated that the prognostic signature had a good prediction efficiency. m6A methylation regulators exert as potential biomarkers for prognostic stratification of ccRCC patients and may assist clinicians achieving individualized treatment for this patient population.",2020,,"list(name = ""Junjun Chen"", ids = ""81677358""); list(name = ""Kun Yu"", ids = ""145465119""); list(name = ""Guansheng Zhong"", ids = ""46642441""); list(name = ""Wei Shen"", ids = ""48157591"")",,,Cancer Cell International,20,

Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for developing drought prediction models due to their high efficiency and accuracy. This study explored the ability of several machine learning models based on penalized linear regression and decision tree (DT)-based ensemble methods to predict drought conditions represented by the Standardized Precipitationâ€“Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in Northeast China. We compared the forecasting performance of the penalized linear regression models based on ridge regression (RR) and lasso regression (LR) with the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. In addition, the AdaBoost and Random Forests (RF) models were also used to explore the suitability of ensemble methods for improving the forecasting performance. The SPEI was forecast at the different timescales of 3, 6, 12, and 24Â months using the aforementioned machine learning models and the indices were used to predict short-term and long-term drought conditions. The prediction results indicated that the penalized linear regression models provided better prediction results and the ensemble methods consistently outperformed the DT model. Overall, the LR models were the optimum models for forecasting the SPEI at different timescales in Northeast China.",2019,Physics,"list(name = ""Zeng Li"", ids = ""115419419""); list(name = ""Taotao Chen"", ids = ""46618513""); list(name = ""Qi Wu"", ids = ""144663764""); list(name = ""Guimin Xia"", ids = ""4743278""); list(name = ""Daocai Chi"", ids = ""89464798"")",,955fcf6643c6946f491e70a96db3ffe3bc719a14; 6ea8591e8d56a627d99e17c38c9cadf5ffbf9e27; c8dff78a7143420def4c4aeec42a64fbf7ab5a03; 06c3665e2fa943ca9b785bdce850a77a749b70c3; ef9745549c97d2e9ee2b4c031489a2f236c70b34; 63e15f9df06a99ec961962b4c69de1e98e7b28f7; 187df815133de321b7afd2cbf2b54d68e76fd6d4; 70bf026395360335fc36a806afd317b830c140ae; c8302b1125d5a0649c905e1b4f44ccee6943d3de; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; a781e7fea8f386c5984385e40263f5757034798e; fcf80601100ff99ed336f946d1d9516f8c7e43ec; bfc48973238deba2e2237c6ef381be7ffc6bb233; 8a1f69928a897aceedffd8d431f3ac0e1b2b3996; 61b55b5be5fd2e5411dea19dedfe2906464c148b; a0456c27cdd58f197032c1c8b4f304f09d4c9bc5; 9593a864aa3fcd20ec9f3a7cd6305f4367bcc4f4; 03c7b312763868d90dc502a91c41be45d1cd6bf6; d4b378731d7a96ba4fe5132241cd13aaecb3df63; 7414e5c2110cce50a75ccfeb5c0d463202ab2e55; 4cde5aa084af9547e3520b7d223a8edcd56031f2; 8b188670e4718756cd36b9a9ef086b23c9bb2264; 4695e699de1c2fda3c71fe14d6bce41426836f47; 108321750ee5884ace0a0a4ce24f973dfa79be34; e62d1bcc3e455f84704de49743a7f2720dc4f74c; 978b179885ad9cd08da8ef466ca717425a4eb82c; 0dcffac2fca3accad5cb22e0ae920c264bbe55cf; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; df2f6f00d610ba4379ac25d2a995224a7c99791a; b7347af2dfee7d6294b9cd64fbc1382d0be56563; 5459c6672fed8b777042075425445893257ef1a3; 32a1c9525707d4ab8d6749cd97244288c3a4b285; 9cc82a03c8e860234784eaf0a6aad78bca05e9bf; 21b1b5feed5543ac316230aa9d48f150650bf924; 10dc7a73f85f3703b8b9b72ed4e9ea171d3a6462; c3f7136d6cb726b295eb34565a8270177c57f40f; c92d205f28c9f8f0e9af9690be464ff6841ec46d; 0a289dd59b8043c0fbe3a4d1ae59055476ddb3ff; b824cb051ffbdd81b529c4b82379a3af270fb6f7; a83d6476bd25c3cc1cbfb89eab245a8fa895ece8; ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292; b7504c08e25a1ed07be22aabc2e91291ef1a72aa; 5735323ca2de1107247b86350ce9f9188761b33b; 5e934c4d76b3c664149f7970ec11c3c8cabab91e; 70ee44786510db7c361aeaab6f37cc008bc9701e; 16b3c8f6f1dffd31271c59c11e17241e51377d68; a78e40cc8b6a88bf6aa896a0a0af39e38eab3c39; 5c8869aec9396e0e04b5bed9c6c07362f65d4794; a7ff2d95962db0342e518c1c69ba01011ca199f0; ec10b1ff74848752c2016bcd1be76e76d3a97ca6; 168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74; d5bddf7c1f05c5f8eba1c13ae7836a13760d403a; 9f751f3c7cdb3d1b682c4502f6b5224006265be6; 4d347b81f8b52caf250063441bd1b92f39c15ed8; fb76df7b3e0fb9353b5d8aabb2a1e1468f6d2878; d4e4c0b23900fabbddf7ae3ec051679c049a4949,Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics,,1-18
e69e29276874e8e8764a83a86fc59a45514381ef,Model Selection and estimation of Multi Screen Penalty,"We propose a multi-step method, called Multi Screen Penalty (MSP), to estimate high-dimensional sparse linear models. MSP uses a series of small and adaptive penalty to iteratively estimate the regression coefficients. This structure is shown to greatly improve the model selection and estimation accuracy, i.e., it precisely selects the true model when the irrepresentable condition fails; under mild regularity conditions, MSP estimator can achieve the rate $\sqrt{q \log n /n}$ for the upper bound of l_2-norm error. At each step, we restrict the selection of MSP only on the reduced parameter space obtained from the last step; this makes its computational complexity is roughly comparable to Lasso. This algorithm is found to be stable and reaches to high accuracy over a range of small tuning parameters, hence deletes the cross-validation segment.

Machine Learning Methods for News Popularity Prediction,"Online website has been the majority source for news to spread. An interesting news is going to be shared thousands of times through the Internet. In this project, we tried different methods to predict the popularity before its publication. Using over 39000 sample articles from Mashable.com, we tried to address the problem both as a numerical and a multinomial classification problem. Specifically, we applied linear regression, polynomial regression, GAM with smoothing splines and Lasso to predict the exact shares. The best CV error result is 0.7649 acquired by GAM with smoothing splines. And then we used SVM, Random Forest and Bagging to predict popularity, which is divided into four categories, for each article. In this case, Random Forest gives us the best result, which achieves 50.4% prediction accuracy.",2015,,"list(name = ""Xuandong Lei"", ids = ""30568627"")",ca1c12fcb5245ec6998121975ad43c0214dcb6d7,86049356e6327c2422e91b6f57cdd37ed46dfbcb; 6952cc377adecd16e4f09b15c56d83aa8c86878d; 06132750ccac50646f7f94ede83cefbb9bbc9095; ad7f3da7a5d6a1e18cc5a176f18f52687b912fea; 16b3c8f6f1dffd31271c59c11e17241e51377d68; 984d1f4522443f0ad6571d342c1b3088420fb4ec,,,

Currently, the most popular data-driven reconstruction framework is based on lasso. However, it is found that, in the presence of noise, lasso loses efficiency for weighted networks. This paper builds a new framework to cope with this problem. The key idea is to employ a series of linear regression problems to model the relationship between network nodes, and then to use an efficient variational Bayesian algorithm to infer the unknown coefficients. The numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the new method outperforms lasso with regard to both reconstruction accuracy and running speed.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shuang Xu"", ids = ""48922832""); list(name = ""Chun-Xia Zhang"", ids = ""2147052""); list(name = ""Pei Wang"", ids = ""46808675""); list(name = ""Jiangshe Zhang"", ids = ""2265568"")",,1708e5e08299ef5def134fc67dfc54d26fb94f4e; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 6a7c63a73724c0ca68b1675e256bb8b9a35c94f4; 839b16bdf0097e4ca7aa8f50f9ce93ab61c0dc84; 6120cc252bc74239012f11b8b075cb7cb16bee26; d0ac2ef3156dde176df00b6489cb8ab5ac1926d7; a462ee3d64edf189e075451ca7cb728bcc9e5fb3; 6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827; 10faccac5e7e412aa980a3173f69f834d34b472c; a34f8d05e44966a5fa2a8bdcf553d3533f1851d8; fc04bb9f30803d8c930d80a2eb8b1ca1e03dd96f; 961f7484e31cecceff1d885c124447afd0c9c344; e953a4720f0318ea95d5710a6f1fdf057af2415e; f119513c7ee212e7c74f3e6e7c5a4b1197df24f4; 3b4c1a9cd76d73b756b483fc6bf2e9e864230fea; 11ee5266d9ae87ef09b438273227d169afca081c; 8c541237488b9bcfe2825a4325694ed81b272835; d98d0d1900b13b87aa4ffd6b69c046beb63f0434; 001b461a56e067f68e4ee4efdeb554113ec9a52c; 0c79f6aac5e93a9b152a23c13dbead3246ddabc6; 2480e186cedf2ba6ef9016d0aad3de37191528c4; e46c7eba674bd0b94f33c71deafe00b2f4621a0e; 50b61f766d08e60acf37f85ed543f85593b7ac33; 788c70451b1165c6273a07eabdef764a58f1d472; 389992866835807256673e9c02d8a33ffe49ed08; 39ac9fe876e3eb5b1093f514a02a6ec5a7952694; b150eba66dfa4dc1a56d20f32e6af906cdb5aff7; 74c53b33dc3bf81888a6764a0924591990a06d04; efcb8a445e386c306bd1ad4738bcedb09b1d925a; 4a8ac5b3046ae990c8f6ab4244476a3ab25d8211; 1df34abffa002b6c782bf7ad9ad59c2b41ad9fb3; cfc74780e402f866e619661ad18061218be63ae9; 17d00ec9a7537004ee83cce5baa57c4d6f1b808c; e1630fbfb75c2c06bda9f76da139283f245b7cea; 11894242565e0388eeb6cf05b59f5a71447fe082; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 0fbec1dba1feae720368de2857b568fbcf97e08d,Inf.

This problem could be solved by a variable selection technique using L1 regularization/LASSO or a dimension reduction approach using principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, both methods were applied to generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution and compared to predict rainfall models at 11 rain posts in Indramayu. More over, generalized linear model with gamma distribution was used to obtain non-negative rainfall prediction and compared with principal component regression (PCR). Two types of ill-conditioned data with different characteristics (CMIP5 and GPCP version 2.2) were used as covariates in SDS modeling. The results show that three methods (PCR, Gamma-PC, and Gamma-L1) did not demonstrate significant difference in term of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) after addition of dummy variables (month) in the models. However, a generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution could be considered as the best methods since it provided non-negative rainfall predictions.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Agus M Soleh"", ids = ""18083682"")",afc5d482a32e85c189411981ca0052d65322ee15,f68d7069bc93ba42361bb7f90d3f771d0978e4b1; f89be3aa29635b1e7f6c8bb40d9aa81acaf41fa5; 695dfd10678715952610b9e8681fdf49d8ad95df; d45c62e02cbd34f8886dbb78cf9d1485ad1b688c; af2d6852dec81e6814de8d44cfdeda5407a6813a; c9927fd62588f4a037d92c603094997c56f910e4,,24,215-222
6e225ba556b646d4016924a9637d87243ea64f08,"Tutz , Binder : Boosting Ridge Regression","Ridge regression is a well established method to shrink regression parameters towards zero, thereby securing existence of estimates. The present paper investigates several approaches to combining ridge regression with boosting techniques. In the direct approach the ridge estimator is used to fit iteratively the current residuals yielding an alternative to the usual ridge estimator. In partial boosting only part of the regression parameters are reestimated within one step of the iterative procedure. The technique allows to distinguish between variables that are always included in the analysis and variables that are chosen only if relevant. The resulting procedure selects variables in a similar way as the Lasso, yielding a reduced set of influential variables. The suggested procedures are investigated within the classical framework of continuous response variables as well as in the case of generalized linear models. In a simulation study boosting procedures for different stopping criteria are investigated and the performance in terms of prediction and the identification of relevant variables is compared to several competitors as the Lasso and the more recently proposed elastic net. For the evaluation of the identification of relevant variables pseudo ROC curves are introduced.",2007,,"list(name = ""Gerhard Tutz"", ids = ""67049458""); list(name = ""Harald Binder"", ids = ""38156792"")",,f7103090b0bc74106025ac96b21b6ce5d1fb569c; e69bce0185720fcb652ae458a4529a2807f53de8; 619518eddc515e3cf306cd66fe3866cbf9843fc7; 7c63aeb09b0e0a2b20ed3154f66c9b6821132c53; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 10179d638070a2f2381f917aeb27768b76cbe3f2; c4335289faa7625d4c043c180ebc2dd3c8a3a109; a11c6af34db514fc4ccec0e54f6bc237b01be6d7; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 7adbaea0b1987e3f4b8e39929f7057e1f03560d5; 6cdad3a1640cd9796f1389e6460f646f7dcb257b; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; d07885ab289de685a91db4dc01c42414e969cc40; 54b3f0acc4792135c5e6960b592f9cf6ad518b18; 74a6c8ffb2995afce8adb5c8ef353402a914267d; 15a2c58b29c5a84a134d1504faff528101321f21; a92684c164b0c46020a371ae5116df74bb37a412; 836c0578a33ad7348c3400f1054ce16568f71ea8; dc06ba65edba6f2783bda42da82d90589508e6ab; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564,,,

The LASSO allows to select variables in optimal ways. We will discuss recent results in three directions: 
(a) variable preselection - to start with a manageable set of covariates - based on a sequential implementation of the LASSO with increasing lists of predictors, exploiting the freezing property of corresponding cross-validation curves; 
(b) measurement error bias correction - because in many applications covariates are subject to measurement error - without the need of repeated measurements in generalized linear models; 
(c) instability of variable screening - due to random partitions in cross validation - in Cox proportional hazard models with interactions.

40b6d5ebc3673ba9868bd3a73ece1ca1592ac9e3,Factors related to parental pre-treatment motivation in outpatient child and adolescent mental health care,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between a variety of child, parent, family and environmental factors and pre-treatment motivation of parents of children and adolescents newly referred to a mental health care clinic in The Netherlands. Data were collected of 521 parents most involved in the upbringing of the child (443 mothers and 78 fathers; Dutch origin 97.1%) of 207 girls and 314 boys (age Mâ€‰=â€‰10.2, range 1â€“18 years). Treatment motivation was measured by the Parent Motivation Inventory. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to investigate the prediction strength of 33 factors in 5 domains: (1) source of referral and prior use of healthcare services, (2) child characteristics, (3) characteristics of the primary parent, (4) parenting characteristics of the primary parent, and (5) family characteristics. Twenty-one factors were statistically relevant, explaining 21.3% of the deviance in pre-treatment motivation. Child characteristics, mainly type and severity of problems, contributed most to the model. Notably, internalising problems contributed more than externalising problems. Furthermore, we found relations between parental pre-treatment motivation and parents' perceived self-efficacy, parents' perceived parenting competence, financial problems and source of referral. Our findings provide insight into the multifacetedness of parental motivation prior to starting treatment and inform health professionals of specific contextual factors of interest in parents' readiness to change their behaviour and participate in treatment.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Halewijn M.

4bab3fc2089b195b1eabdd11f51eeef62792d91d,Detecting disease-causing genes by LASSO-Patternsearch algorithm,"The Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 3 simulated rheumatoid arthritis data set provided 100 replicates of simulated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and covariate data sets for 1500 families with an affected sib pair and 2000 controls, modeled after real rheumatoid arthritis data. The data generation model included nine unobserved trait loci, most of which have one or more of the generated SNPs associated with them. These data sets provide an ideal experimental test bed for evaluating new and old algorithms for selecting SNPs and covariates that can separate cases from controls, because the cases and controls are known as well as the identities of the trait loci. LASSO-Patternsearch is a new multi-step algorithm with a LASSO-type penalized likelihood method at its core specifically designed to detect and model interactions between important predictor variables. In this article the original LASSO-Patternsearch algorithm is modified to handle the large number of SNPs plus covariates. We start with a screen step within the framework of parametric logistic regression. The patterns that survived the screen step were further selected by a penalized logistic regression with the LASSO penalty.

Regularization methods are tools to help researchers avoid overestimating the coefficients of individual predictor variables in multiple regression, especially in high-dimensional problems. Such methods introduce some bias into estimates, at greatly reduced variance: regularized models will typically fit somewhat worse in-sample but will generalize better than unregularized models out-of-sample. These regularization techniques can be implemented using a classical, Frequentist methods, but have natural implementations using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We provide the Bayesian interpretation of the most common Frequentist regularization techniques, the ridge and the lasso. We describe the theory in elementary terms, and provide worked examples to demonstrate how regularized estimates can be obtained using the freely available R statistical computing environment and JAGS Bayesian analysis engine.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Seth M.

24db1c66bd0a8475e20304b625ffcad6acb0d73e,Model order reduction techniques for power amplifier digital predistortion linearization,"To address the known trade-off between linearity and efficiency of the PA, several linearization techniques have been proposed in the literature. Among them, the most widespread technique is now digital predistortion (DPD) a technique that existing mathematical models that model the behavior of the PA is used, these models are composed of several terms each multiplied by a coefficient. Dealing with broadband signals (tens and hundreds of MHz), it implies an increase in the number of coefficients required in the behavioral model of DPD to compensate both nonlinear effects and memory of PAs. Increasing the number of coefficients has a negative impact on the identification of these, as it not only increases the computational complexity of the extraction (usually carried out by linear regression least squares (LS)), but can lead to problems overfitting and uncertainty. The model order reduction DPD has the dual effect of mitigating the computational complexity and improve the conditioning of the matrix of regressors. The strategy used to reduce the model order PAs, is based partly on regularization techniques such as regression Ridge or Tikhonov, and the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. Other techniques will be based on OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) combined with BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Present a study of the amplifier and some behavioral models PAs, then some of the existing linearization techniques, to stop focusing on DPD. Then we will focus on the reduction techniques PA behavioral model and experimental to finish making a comparison of all results.",2016,Engineering,"list(name = ""M.

While covariate pre-specification is the preferred approach for improving power to estimate regressionadjusted average treatment effects (ATEs), further precision gains can be achieved through covariate selection once primary outcomes have been collected. This article uses design-based methods underlying clustered RCTs to develop a Lasso-OLS hybrid procedure for the post-hoc selection of covariates and ATE estimation that avoids model overfitting and lack of transparency. In the first stage, lasso estimation is conducted using cluster-level averages, where asymptotic normality is proved using a new central limit theorem for finite population regression estimators. In the second stage, ATEs and design-based standard errors are estimated using weighted least squares with the first stage lasso covariates. This nonparametric approach applies to continuous, binary, and discrete outcomes. Simulation results indicate that Type 1 errors of the second stage ATE estimates are near nominal values and standard errors are near true ones, although somewhat conservative with small samples. The method is demonstrated using data from a large, federally funded clustered RCT testing the effects of school-based programs promoting behavioral health.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peter Z.

9e2bd3a686a19ed323a6c056ff943eb7b037b8a4,Unbalance identification using the least angle regression technique,"Abstract The present investigation proposes a robust procedure for unbalance identification using the equivalent load method based on sparse vibration measurements. The procedure is demonstrated and benchmarked on an example rotor at constant speed. Since the number of measuring positions is much smaller than the number of possible fault locations, performing unbalance identification leads to an ill-posed problem. This problem was tried to be overcome previously with modal expansion in the time domain and with several linear regressions in the frequency domain. However, since the solution to the problem is a sparse equivalent force vector, these methods cannot provide a robust identification procedure. A robust identification can only be achieved by providing a-priori information on the number of unbalances to be identified. The presently proposed procedure achieves more precise unbalance identification without the need of a-priori information by incorporating a regularization technique. A well-known technique for producing sparse solutions is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The proposed procedure is based on the generalized technique Least Angle Regression (LAR) which finds all the solutions of LASSO. A comparison of the time-domain approach, the frequency-domain approach and the proposed technique is made and the superiority of the latter technique in identifying the number of possible fault locations is highlighted. The selection of the threshold of the convergence algorithm of LAR as well as the selection of the value of the Lagrangian multiplier is discussed in some detail.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ioannis Chatzisavvas"", ids = ""9341195""); list(name = ""F.

60365833e7d9e3bb7225a799536883fc5dac1604,Identification of gene expression-based prognostic markers in the hematopoietic stem cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,"PURPOSE
The diagnosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is largely dependent on morphologic examination of bone marrow aspirates. Several criteria that form the basis of the classifications and scoring systems most commonly used in clinical practice are affected by operator-dependent variation. To identify standardized molecular markers that would allow prediction of prognosis, we have used gene expression profiling (GEP) data on CD34+ cells from patients with MDS to determine the relationship between gene expression levels and prognosis.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
GEP data on CD34+ cells from 125 patients with MDS with a minimum 12-month follow-up since date of bone marrow sample collection were included in this study. Supervised principal components and lasso penalized Cox proportional hazards regression (Coxnet) were used for the analysis.


RESULTS
We identified several genes, the expression of which was significantly associated with survival of patients with MDS, including LEF1, CDH1, WT1, and MN1. The Coxnet predictor, based on expression data on 20 genes, outperformed other predictors, including one that additionally used clinical information. Our Coxnet gene signature based on CD34+ cells significantly identified a separation of patients with good or bad prognosis in an independent GEP data set based on unsorted bone marrow mononuclear cells, demonstrating that our signature is robust and may be applicable to bone marrow cells without the need to isolate CD34+ cells.


CONCLUSION
We present a new, valuable GEP-based signature for assessing prognosis in MDS. GEP-based signatures correlating with clinical outcome may significantly contribute to a refined risk classification of MDS.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrea Pellagatti"", ids = ""4157607""); list(name = ""Axel Benner"", ids = ""2836909""); list(name = ""Kenneth Ian Mills"", ids = ""3412168""); list(name = ""Mario Cazzola"", ids = ""7621301""); list(name = ""Aristoteles Giagounidis"", ids = ""33351623""); list(name = ""Janet Perry"", ids = ""50036313""); list(name = ""Luca Malcovati"", ids = ""4474269""); list(name = ""Matteo Giovanni Della Porta"", ids = ""122394913""); list(name = ""Martin JÃ¤dersten"", ids = ""4152621""); list(name = ""Amit Verma"", ids = ""48124452""); list(name = ""Emma-Jane McDonald"", ids = ""46473896""); list(name = ""Sally Killick"", ids = ""48989307""); list(name = ""Eva HellstrÃ¶m-Lindberg"", ids = ""1395887851""); list(name = ""Lars Bullinger"", ids = ""80789507""); list(name = ""J.

db80d10494326a0de094729b9d83631255abbfe1,A fast and efficient smoothing approach to LASSO regression and an application in statistical genetics: polygenic risk scores for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"We consider solving a high dimensional linear regression problem, using LASSO to account for sparsity. Though the LASSO objective function is convex, it is not differentiable everywhere, making the use of gradient descent methods for minimization not straightforward. To avoid this technical issue, we suggest to use Nesterov smoothing of the LASSO objective function which enables us to compute closed form derivatives for efficient and fast minimization. The contribution of this work is threefold: (1) We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute estimates of the LASSO regression parameters; (2) we prove explicit bounds on the accuracy of the obtained estimates which show that the estimates obtained through the smoothed problem can be made arbitrary close to the ones of the original (unsmoothed) LASSO problem; (3) we propose an iterative procedure of the proposed approach to progressively smooth the objective function, which facilitates minimization and increases accuracy. Using simulation studies for polygenic risk scores based on genetic data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COPD, we evaluate accuracy and runtime of the proposed approaches and compare them with the current standard in the literature. The results of the simulation studies suggest that the proposed methodology, progressive smoothing, provides estimates with higher accuracy than standard approaches that rely on GLMNET and that the differences are of practical relevance, while the computation time for progressive smoothing increases only be a constant factor, compared to GLMNET.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Georg Hahn"", ids = ""47969459""); list(name = ""Sharon Marie Lutz"", ids = ""18440472""); list(name = ""Nilanjana Laha"", ids = ""90226108""); list(name = ""Christoph Lange"", ids = ""144617511"")",,659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 955c0fef6e10b222bdbbbb79e2d7c0063df85cbe; ab48eaf420cf4b42627cc5b2b4a2a94d902fd5a1; f43613178b7e9eea7426f9fb3651cc924da99549; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; 8e6c6086ea725737aa6081a57ea68d43a24ca3b9; 97ecc99784dcbe4b26fe5c0d7c2fffab00e94b07; 39623d1e1d3489d7fb4f156c89d85157c758280f; cbd09c1a7edf43b25a072523fe40fa6e83c83e82; 3ccce8175def336d05a0c19910064d301b01cdee; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc,bioRxiv,,

To improve prognosis, a screening biomarker for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is in urgent need. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles as potential cancer prognostic biomarkers play critical roles in development of tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer. However, lncRNA signatures in predicting the survival of a patient with PDAC remain unknown. In the current study, we try to identify potential lncRNA biomarkers and their prognostic values in PDAC. LncRNAs expression profiles and corresponding clinical information for 182 cases with PDAC were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 14â€‰470 lncRNA were identified in the cohort, and 175 PDAC patients had clinical variables. We obtained 108 differential expressed lncRNA via R packages. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, lasso regression was performed to screen the potential prognostic lncRNA. Five lncRNAs have been recognized to significantly correlate with OS. We established a linear prognostic model of five lncRNA (C9orf139, MIR600HG, RP5-965G21.4, RP11-436K8.1, and CTC-327F10.4) and divided patients into high- and low-risk group according to the prognostic index. The five lncRNAs played independent prognostic biomarkers of OS of PDAC patients and the AUC of the ROC curve for the five lncRNAs signatures prediction 5-year survival was 0.742. In addition, targeted genes of MIR600HG, C9orf139, and CTC-327F10.4 were explored and functional enrichment was also conducted.

44165956328b5d07c82d95e682648efcb09ecc8f,Covariance matrix selection and estimation via penalised normal likelihood,"We propose a nonparametric method for identifying parsimony and for producing a statistically efficient estimator of a large covariance matrix. We reparameterise a covariance matrix through the modified Cholesky decomposition of its inverse or the one-step-ahead predictive representation of the vector of responses and reduce the nonintuitive task of modelling covariance matrices to the familiar task of model selection and estimation for a sequence of regression models. The Cholesky factor containing these regression coefficients is likely to have many off-diagonal elements that are zero or close to zero. Penalised normal likelihoods in this situation with L-sub-1 and L-sub-2 penalities are shown to be closely related to Tibshirani's (1996) LASSO approach and to ridge regression. Adding either penalty to the likelihood helps to produce more stable estimators by introducing shrinkage to the elements in the Cholesky factor, while, because of its singularity, the L-sub-1 penalty will set some elements to zero and produce interpretable models. An algorithm is developed for computing the estimator and selecting the tuning parameter. The proposed maximum penalised likelihood estimator is illustrated using simulation and a real dataset involving estimation of a 102 Ã— 102 covariance matrix.

50bdb364b5fa74e30422023738bbbd1e16bdab52,False Discoveries Occur Early on the Lasso Path,"In regression settings where explanatory variables have very low correlations and there are relatively few effects, each of large magnitude, we expect the Lasso to find the important variables with few errors, if any. This paper shows that in a regime of linear sparsity---meaning that the fraction of variables with a non-vanishing effect tends to a constant, however small---this cannot really be the case, even when the design variables are stochastically independent. We demonstrate that true features and null features are always interspersed on the Lasso path, and that this phenomenon occurs no matter how strong the effect sizes are. We derive a sharp asymptotic trade-off between false and true positive rates or, equivalently, between measures of type I and type II errors along the Lasso path. This trade-off states that if we ever want to achieve a type II error (false negative rate) under a critical value, then anywhere on the Lasso path the type I error (false positive rate) will need to exceed a given threshold so that we can never have both errors at a low level at the same time. Our analysis uses tools from approximate message passing (AMP) theory as well as novel elements to deal with a possibly adaptive selection of the Lasso regularizing parameter.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Weijie Su"", ids = ""145499378""); list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""34616072""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

It is often conducted through monitoring the time series of sensors, which usually includes outliers and change points. We adopt a deep learning model LSTM for monitoring the condition of boilers and chillers in a central heating and cooling plant. A two stage approach for condition monitoring is used: condition prediction and anomaly detection. In condition prediction stage, we use a LSTM model and three regression models: LASSO, SVR, and MLP to predict the energy efficiency of boilers and chillers. The experiments show that LSTM is able to establish a robust normal behavior of multiple boilers and chillers. LSTM reaches a lower prediction error than that of other three models in six out of nine boilers and chillers. In anomaly detection stage, we detect outliers or change points using the prediction errors from the LSTM model earlier than other models.

71d09926235d7be15ff6cbfdddd2f05d6a9388c9,"Feature Selection with the R Package MXM: Discovering Multiple, Statistically-Equivalent, Predictive Feature Subsets","The statistically equivalent signature (SES) algorithm is a method for feature selection inspired by the principles of constrained-based learning of Bayesian Networks. Most of the currently available feature-selection methods return only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest predictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve close to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one has several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive feature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under that respect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like the maxmin parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonym function included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning â€™mind from the machineâ€™ in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several data-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis. In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide examples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three publicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures retrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature selection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two methods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that multiple, equally predictive signatures are actually present in real world data.",2019,,"list(name = ""Vincenzo Lagani"", ids = ""2254420""); list(name = ""Michail Tsagris"", ids = ""1388363187"")",9586dec5f91895e4257ad20d54e07dfdce323ac3,56ea58a402105600fc55db08465a8cd4dac1af0c; 6ff6b42a16a2e70813f6728cf4d0b672939235ec; e06a27ad67aed313ac97e2d79dda274961e27aae; 1c6356a688a273889fb71bab17973ed10483d97f; 6a324ff29bca5cb4584ca869a9bab987fc8bed3f; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 0c88444cf4be49515b9d80b263b5fbeb62866899; 67f3be70523cd355dc79832bb1ae3d76d4689e8a; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9; dd8530e60e27ac3e739d8baa5243787d8db1ea34; 11a5248f2bfbd93538aed858c5d9a6ef154565be; 2946bab413a4feac144746c1f806e20b3ac052cf; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 140e28b488407e4c52bd3b201c44f1f3e693d241; c0036e999bc4fd36ef9e6e4dcffbf7fe17fd47d5; 25ccbf22a0049eb3ea890478e0fa8849d6a7006b; b60a919ec7794b5e21868bd5728a7c66550c0cd0; bc4d9febd19e30f376e4d26deeeb75047bde24d4; 1a9bac113a3bd0752b908abe9f292816a3f12e83; a79ca51c3bf63b241cdc77858119be349a8a94ba; 40414d71c9706806960f6551a1ff53cc87488899; 67b18b7b1776f009d9d65902c1fbf8dab5b69af3; 3dbfa6cfadcba90263dc01e575a3044e0b1abe72; 1becb091a0513fdef5279b0343caa94e6f8f426b; 4acca1ebf9a30365a59647c5d1f9d2ea4b9a444a; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; aba73f6957bce1648f066935f7ea85a99119be5d; 9a88e2f53f8a38d4a8f91a43099798b19bb9ef5c; d40ee5dd758c525dfb9932d726bb4e844b7b8478; da9670f5867a0abfef9d26561f2cce3df6f9b940; d8384f7ef288d2d5cb267128471c5427fc98b54b; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 05baf4756aa11297657c1c83641a3834d2accdf0; f3c0ad0efa1e2d6447f9e200179d3c6aa33df981; 39129add37dcc96b2ba9b1a3dff05ee684289a93; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 337cf6f24a3afcce9def5ec6d4b788d64c27afd9,,,
b09d2c9cbd85bd4b6aaddeda47ab907ad379b6be,Problematic internet use as an age-related multifaceted problem: Evidence from a two-site survey,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Problematic internet use (PIU; otherwise known as Internet Addiction) is a growing problem in modern societies. There is scarce knowledge of the demographic variables and specific internet activities associated with PIU and a limited understanding of how PIU should be conceptualized. Our aim was to identify specific internet activities associated with PIU and explore the moderating role of age and gender in those associations.


METHODS
We recruited 1749 participants aged 18 and above via media advertisements in an Internet-based survey at two sites, one in the US, and one in South Africa; we utilized Lasso regression for the analysis.


RESULTS
Specific internet activities were associated with higher problematic internet use scores, including general surfing (lasso Î²: 2.1), internet gaming (Î²: 0.6), online shopping (Î²: 1.4), use of online auction websites (Î²: 0.027), social networking (Î²: 0.46) and use of online pornography (Î²: 1.0). Age moderated the relationship between PIU and role-playing-games (Î²: 0.33), online gambling (Î²: 0.15), use of auction websites (Î²: 0.35) and streaming media (Î²: 0.35), with older age associated with higher levels of PIU. There was inconclusive evidence for gender and genderâ€¯Ã—â€¯internet activities being associated with problematic internet use scores. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social anxiety disorder were associated with high PIU scores in young participants (ageâ€¯â‰¤â€¯25, Î²: 0.35 and 0.65 respectively), whereas generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were associated with high PIU scores in the older participants (ageâ€¯>â€¯55, Î²: 6.4 and 4.3 respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Many types of online behavior (e.g. shopping, pornography, general surfing) bear a stronger relationship with maladaptive use of the internet than gaming supporting the diagnostic classification of problematic internet use as a multifaceted disorder. Furthermore, internet activities and psychiatric diagnoses associated with problematic internet use vary with age, with public health implications.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Konstantinos Ioannidis"", ids = ""2378908""); list(name = ""Matthias S.

1e5dc712054cbb0e00afb2c077c8c051d149b2cf,A Pass to Variable Selection,"Many regularized procedures produce sparse solution and therefore are sometimes used for variable selection in linear regression. It has been showed that regularized procedures are more stable than subset selection. Such procedures include LASSO, SCAD, and adaptive LASSO, to name just a few. However, their performance depends crucially on the tuning parameter selection. For the purpose of prediction, popular methods for the tuning parameter selection include Cp, cross-validation, and generalized cross-validation. For the purpose of variable selection, the most popular method for the tuning parameter selection is BIC. The selection consistency of BIC for some regularized procedures have been shown. However, knowing degrees of freedom is required in the use of BIC. For many regularized procedures, such as those for graphical models and clustering algorithms, the formulae for degrees of freedom do not exist.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yixin Fang"", ids = ""48802901"")",,99bde5c9e41596c2440225c78cb9ab64c084acb4; c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics,7,
d4c3f250b47a218a7ce4828c4ee87b95fc0b6ff0,Analysis of Bayesian LASSO Using High Dimensional Data,"The sparse models play an important role in the field of machine learning. It can dimensionality reduction and effectively solve the over-fitting problem in modeling. The Bayesian method forms a priori distribution by fusing different information to obtain high-quality statistical inference. This paper summarizes the representative sparse model LASSO and Bayesian theory-based model Bayesian LASSO, and discussed the relationship between the two models. Through numeric experiments, the effects of the two models on variable selection were compared, and the parameter estimation of Bayesian LASSO under different prior conditions is further analyzed. Results attained showed that the two models have good effects in the variable selection. When the number of samples is small, especially when the number of samples is much smaller than the number of features, the effect of Bayesian LASSO is more prominent. It is also possible to estimate the model parameters and calculate the Bayesian confidence interval for each regression coefficient at a certain level of confidence, which is more flexible and convenient.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xuan Huang"", ids = ""49444734""); list(name = ""Yinsong Ye"", ids = ""104022725"")",,,,,75-82

1f84aa49131e355d72a16faa98ca2f742757cd48,Mining Prognostic Biomarkers of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Immune-Associated Genes.,"This research aims to investigate the immune-associated gene signature from databases to improve the prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by multidimensional methods using various bioinformatic methods. Fifty-one immune-associated genes were mined out, which were associated with clinical characters through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and 51 immune-associated genes could be well-divided HCC samples into high-risk and low-risk clusters. Next, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method to reveal 18 immune-associated genes' signature and calculate risk score of each gene for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Comparing with low-risk cluster, high-risk cluster had higher risk score with unfavorable prognosis. Then, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that risk score of 18 immune-associated genes' signature was associated with tumor invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. ROC analysis indicated combined TNM stage, and risk score performed more sensitive and specific than single TNM stage or risk score in survival prediction. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis found that the pathways enriched in tumorigenesis were related to risk score, and those pathways could separate HCC samples into high and low clusters. In addition, the survival prediction of 18 immune-associated genes' signature was well validated in independent test data set, external data set, and Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment. The 18 immune-associated genes' signature was constructed, which could be used in effective prediction of HCC prognosis.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wen-biao Chen"", ids = ""7307979""); list(name = ""Donge Tang"", ids = ""48023594""); list(name = ""Minglin Ou"", ids = ""39566129""); list(name = ""Yong Dai"", ids = ""143950670"")",,,DNA and cell biology,,
