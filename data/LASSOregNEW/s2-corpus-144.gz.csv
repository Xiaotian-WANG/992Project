Recent evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to hepatogenesis and a few aggressive features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing studies demonstrate that lncRNAs are potential prognostic factors for HCC. Moreover, several studies reported the combination of lncRNAs for predicting the overall survival (OS) of HCC, but the results varied. Thus, more effort including more accurate statistical approaches is needed for exploring the prognostic value of lncRNAs in HCC.


AIM
To develop a robust lncRNA signature associated with HCC recurrence to improve prognosis prediction of HCC.


METHODS
Univariate COX regression analysis was performed to screen the lncRNAs significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HCC in GSE76427 for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) modelling. The established lncRNA signature was validated and developed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) series using Kaplan-Meier curves. The expression values of the identified lncRNAs were compared between the tumor and non-tumor tissues. Pathway enrichment of these lncRNAs was conducted based on the significantly co-expressed genes. A prognostic nomogram combining the lncRNA signature and clinical characteristics was constructed.


RESULTS
The lncRNA signature consisted of six lncRNAs: MSC-AS1, POLR2J4, EIF3J-AS1, SERHL, RMST, and PVT1. This risk model was significantly associated with the RFS of HCC in the TCGA cohort with a hazard ratio (HR) being 1.807 (95%CI [confidence interval]: 1.329-2.457) and log-rank P-value being less than 0.001. The best candidates of the six-lncRNA signature were younger male patients with HBV infection in relatively early tumor-stage and better physical condition but with higher preoperative alpha-fetoprotein. All the lncRNAs were significantly upregulated in tumor samples compared to non-tumor samples (P < 0.05). The most significantly enriched pathways of the lncRNAs were TGF-Î² signaling pathway, cellular apoptosis-associated pathways, etc. The nomogram showed great utility of the lncRNA signature in HCC recurrence risk stratification.


CONCLUSION
We have constructed a six-lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction of HCC. This risk model provides new clinical evidence for the accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment of HCC.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing-Xian Gu"", ids = ""28029610""); list(name = ""Xing Zhang"", ids = ""46448540""); list(name = ""Run-Chen Miao"", ids = ""104508198""); list(name = ""Xiao-hong Xiang"", ids = ""40143299""); list(name = ""Yu-Nong Fu"", ids = ""145132269""); list(name = ""Jingyao Zhang"", ids = ""49050249""); list(name = ""Chang Liu"", ids = ""39664999""); list(name = ""Kai Qu"", ids = ""18116850"")",a5d804b35aa4d29d1679be62954ed371b654a040; 120a03d5770045b882678a3dd3131517f327f9c2; 1665318ae6690c1da33d4638f0a6ea3fbf994ec4; 57efa1d1ce6e7951fe34e8e2e2d44200c5267e07; 2d277cd5eccf22719de8fa76ae92df76d1eb9f75; 0cece5d180de0751979fbe4121eaa120004c8794; afdf67cc242966cc75c2f0e2b44f0f9a7864b028; dd4a7da433475e42a42c01c16be887e58a1a53d0; 36374347ca70def633c9fb50960bc9c96ec214e6; b44b875c570f38040bf3ddb532936dbb3667dc30; 7b31ff0a8c3aa6a28f31bb11b0df23ec31f6bea9; 51973a13767d2e4876d8cb1be55e2ff2ef945ede; f7540090c39c355c4db5866d586bb931debaa948; 404c4e1f4c8911f37d57be22faa95659182879c9; 7ab66787c9671bb019f015a14c78767f7d19b464,eab4b219f5cace4820b158863eb6455a5ce808cd; c051f2ec35716226d3176b8689b329f671407049; a97e217f8821423536f3fea638e82240719bc29d; ba10a616715b79b73362e969f738230d14be6830; 4b47c18e74ab5286df446ad51d0f9768050c0a31; 6b42e0e10a962803ba7115dbbf8ab6b3a8e40dfa; ed427b568a6635af35dd177d98d5d3e34f344daf; bed435222ddb9e9390677ad3eef22422468512e8; 1042554e1ba4bfa3c7ed9425fbff8589902f9101; 1dc717c0399706595264dd77b2411dfe644c42e6; cd8c4ccb566ffbdb034d2f9430dbfb2fd6fdd5fe; 817c28b8d4f3d36273714b21628d0dfdcb49f861; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; ef067ccec4bcfbe128a374074ed6e1e5ddf5eb3c; f29c3c7f93e681ae2777e73e4cd9a7dd5648ed02; d4b85af9dc14fbe23be5794ee6c5f4b7ab88015b; deafd8b5ef7236c3f8b0895d25e1f073fb9291cb; 291f61de8943450a31de87d2da92fe5b6c99b6e7; a220f789a0cd391d6f07260de6ee49b6aab37c0c; a6b4e6bc9c6f04d7fc7998558f7f1c703d026444; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; ee0dd3a6ece610a1842692aba9e7ef863bc314db; eb59bc95d3d45da27865e66a7e9d84e42816dd6f; 2813a7c5912bf79324e1387f0dfea848de0ef332; ba5932c76ff1fcc0f5209302f7e32f0ec63ef8be; 2f3c851447d3b6e2810fc4931fc23bdbefd57521; 56af99b50ad7e50233ada75d294e40fac45ec0ac,World Journal of Gastroenterology,25,220 - 232

55b133c5fc2f118b3ae80b45520b4e7a26dc503a,Targeted Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive LASSO-Based Randomized Controlled Trials,"We present a new covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomized controlled trial design and inferential procedure built on top of it. The procedure is targeted in the sense that {\em (i)} the sequence of randomization schemes is group-sequentially determined by targeting a user-specified optimal randomization design based on accruing data and, {\em (ii)} our estimator of the user-specified parameter of interest, seen as the value of a functional evaluated at the true, unknown distribution of the data, is targeted toward it by following the paradigm of targeted minimum loss estimation. We focus for clarity on the case that the parameter of interest is the marginal effect of a binary treatment and that the targeted optimal design is the Neyman allocation, in an effort to produce an estimator with smaller asymptotic variance. For clarity too, we consider the case that the estimator of the conditional outcome given treatment and baseline covariates, a key element of the procedure, is obtained by LASSO regression. Under mild assumptions, the resulting sequence of randomization schemes converges to a limiting design, and the TMLE estimator is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Its asymptotic variance can be estimated too. Thus we can build valid confidence intervals of given asymptotic levels. A simulation study confirms our theoretical results.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Antoine Chambaz"", ids = ""1814359""); list(name = ""Wenjing Zheng"", ids = ""34201619""); list(name = ""Mark J. van der Laan"", ids = ""145099512"")",a8e7b5d20dea4ca311a6d6dd55e5d2fe022ba0f0; 9508d20fd459991d78f35c70150838d4ceca63ac; ce739673f677bd73694b39c4a804ce8b333106fb; fa14b07295b80a88833ff5281b2bb067ed44ecdc; 88b4a63f544b2d9fcc797dde768a813458c1dcce; 7218dd4d5069a44e932072e6b694f934e06aea42; 7e96f39b2760bec4f694d309376b4f32c0f6a29b,b10b335237630f3d7a28ad7d60e54b323dcd8bab; c11738954facdf489ea0cda620231953028c54cc; ea6a897b6a15bda291b754cf37f40926906c0775; cf58ae558b11019a69a8a7665a25c220dd0cff4d; edc55787f4b8ef856402c9005bc7c241fb060a18; 65f2a77c8a70291d0f82e0cdb46c23c8b1006946; 8e1718ec62eeeac13e551117dbaf90c462de06dd; 38b59dfcd0770cd3242b390a6524d8624e803860; 3185b90091740a805960ff10a6dfea07993a89cd; 514321dad84993430b7bc1de1c05e25f99e2f7c5; b8160ac3f34352b4f1fa99cb49bd72acef31240e; 8e8d2a1857a36d4700325bf7f7f500ac97f04927; 16636e58cc259f2800ca953907f45450b35e1c8a,,,
2d7c82408b1ca973ec0a86982ba61d228cfc2a07,"Leveraging latent structure in high-dimensional data: causality, neuroscience, and nonparametrics","Author(s): Bloniarz, Adam | Advisor(s): Yu, Bin | Abstract: Many scientific fields have been changed by rapid technological progress in data collection, storage, and processing. This has greatly expanded the role of statistics in scientific research. The three chapters of this thesis examine core challenges faced by statisticians engaged in scientific collaborations, where the complexity of the data require use of high-dimensional or nonparametric methods, and statistical methods need to leverage lower dimensional structure that exists in the data. The first chapter concerns the promise and challenge of using large datasets to uncover causal mechanisms. Randomized trials remain the gold-standard for inferring causal effects of treatment a century after their introduction by Fisher and Neyman. In this chapter, we examine whether large numbers of auxilary covariates in a randomized experiment can be leveraged to help improve estimates of the treatment effect and increase power. In particular, we investigate Lasso-based adjustments of treatment effects through theory, simulation, and a case study of a randomized trial of the pulmonary artery cathether. In our investigation, we avoid imposing a linear model, and examine the robustness of Lasso to violations of traditional assumptions.The second chapter examines the use of predictive models to elucidate functional properties of the mammalian visual cortex. We investigate the activity of single neurons in area MT when stimulated with natural video. One way to investigate single-neuron activity is to build encoding models that predict spike rate given an arbitrary natural stimulus. In this work, we develop encoding models that combine a nonlinear feature extraction step with a linear model. The feature extraction step is unsupervised, and is based on the principle of sparse coding. We compare this model to one that applies relatively simple, fixed nonlinearities to the outputs of V1-like spatiotemporal filters. We find evidence that some MT cells may be tuned to more complex video features than previously thought.The third chapter examines a computational challenge inherent in nonparametric modeling of large datasets. Large datasets are often stored across many machines in a computer cluster, where communication between machines is slow. Hence, nonparametric regression methods should avoid communication of data as much as possible. Random forests, among the most popular nonparametric methods for regression, are not well-suited to distributed architectures. We develop a modification of random forests that leverage ideas in nonparametric regression by local modeling. Our method allows for training of random forests completely in parallel, without synchronization between machines, with communication of sufficient statistics at test-time only. We show that this method can improve the predictive performance of standard random forests even in the single-machine case, and that performance remains strong when data is distributed.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Adam Bloniarz"", ids = ""2728564"")",,2805537bec87a6177037b18f9a3a9d3f1038867b; ababe42d14d08e1c92b795f0e22cf492c75cc16b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b81e61b920b986ff1495af426aad7437c9011d85; f698203b49d36241a71e5512c9095c78542cf9ff; 158389ee04a1b519f3191b881de2e3f7a899b5d6; a85f4321cfe25a400e110e38d778b8237de4404d; a0858dd960c635c3e6294908b794fae52f66e42f; 1f3f205c24cc104f81b9b5bded33268393e11a95; e9263c9646e13c6ad9e4bcca2fb0f77c0fd1d169; d90a98dbd297e3b57f166ea139258660188792ed; fe96483ba3f34ca4565e81a5cb130f66c02cf681; fa9e0b65ef3b171e5e40c44c0bb4b29fac4af496; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 0d130deb9d9af3c00ea1b9a12f9e9db6b41b0031; bb42e453849f74fc0cd7762f07ffae72fb5caa71; 1d883e92941c1db1feaca4ab943e80d196d13402; 9c980c5477c1f1a369a19dd954c936185bbd8b82; db34d106ea2d3403a3d9ccf22cc80d079772d7c8; 2f0be7ef09295368bb1b1f01945ff337e0d44b39; 04bd3574794891c3f7c5038abcab7589002fb85e; f7accdf4efb122ae50f784e663c218fcbdb6b0da; 89f96c3438f56fe447ec9defe622055892b419f1; f555892206c2fd773b6c4d311dc616f9aa3fae23; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; 2a9895703bc01d4c262a8502fc4abf26f8b864fb; 40b062e49ff67e889f76b1b9de9b47b092bdfefb; ac402380e5b69b3ddf189dfb10735d9fc526501c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e438e377c4aa1603f88069e5e52feb9f2b8c3c1d; 4d35319b19a3c6ce802f03d0f3c0b41c91addbc3; 0dd289358b14f8176adb7b62bf2fb53ea62b3818; 498efaa51f5eda731dc6199c3547b9465717fa68; 4130a241f0182e9d1c24aba33a1ed8dd6a888c67; 6503fcffc6692b99f467815d2a3471116115f5bd; 2820973cf69daba62547f76de082bed5e1c646e6; 9e6c798940c9998477a462b50e0a5b07259f1056; 8d1e8dbc14f6dcc2f05d4c05fa78a78a5d16fa74; 5aaf311172b9778d78f6904fbe40124c63463b57; 1cd1579ec956716a0e06625fd3d261274c04d262; 29a662662539b9b4f74f24b3e7c3b6b9d9d42e29; 0f148c3db26be57ab90498ba7434bb8199f4cf0b; 8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6; 770805636ea667364bdf02a7471afabc7dee35b2; 7a2af6871286b7e31162a088c4122c49043bfd65; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 45db76270416a42517a21c63a77e9c4260fa979a; 3e9a1daf09d089dd365142291ac8e4d68d4afb6b; b0f29161f64afe7b9d2b24f4cf15ff77359beb11; cc73bacd6a00442570d15e122604ad6862b8663d; cf8f4fe370aa731d5ec09a7c905f3258e4681e77; 3127190433230b3dc1abd0680bb58dced4bcd90e; c5f5311fa1f34159ab3a0a1d58da51cd0340a640; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 030a25b55b526fff052fa3b5afb70986f5fd40b7; 6dbaff29d3898cf60f63f5a34cb9610ebb75220c; 17228a0f580480191c3003289d7c910154370f8e; 0bb3df8cfca9f04bc5ad21cd9851603a7a1fb31f; 54f41c525b810ed0c10d1c79e31f0da28e2e7392; 7333e127b62eb545d81830df2a66b98c0693a32b; 0bbba72496c1390dbb6cb2d4eba661f182971fe7; d80595cb291e5e017165f27f3062922e0ceda449; 8012c4a1e2ca663f1a04e80cbb19631a00cbab27; 34122df837465c1f2025fabc3209964e7a3a205b; 545122e2990590524459ec9b59ccac6ce71e3b6a; 0c738fdfa27450e6f35b963335db02f20f4bf687; cb34f2a68b5ba96189e78ec9dd937660ffc08bd3; 109974f8eee235de94ed270a1cc4bb3deff6d78c; c2fcb00fe4b773f9cb1682aaa69749aac59f711d; 5e307a51a6c520797027c84789c7eace612e51fd; b310313a00490e260e46efd0a1116f5f1f29d90a; 1955266a8a58d94e41ad0efe20d707c92a069e95; 4b3d5bb0f9597fff321d3d48e0d22b2cae7e648a; c66b40e54fcb1d748aa04d82f497f24ac22d6129; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 3d7756a9e3a4e6256602a05657e9874740a4d13e; 3a00350e920d51988a7f7c5284f55a3fe497f859; 09370d132a1e238a778f5e39a7a096994dc25ec1; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; 725cd02f9ab4e5e4f7db6ef0d2ff5b13819a6fc1; fe86c9ef608d5cd33c496d182879192287cf8569; 607f67568ffd5bfd82cf26a8e2fdd10419cb2169; 280329af506b1b1fa7015840a5504c02057c1d0d; 36f49b05d764bf5c10428b082c2d96c13c4203b9; ac056badb827feecbad5bdcf06e9e29da27761cf; 5531306ba9dea531496bc282d40705b1c309c7ba; e8f811399746c059bf4d4c3d43334045e0222209; 4df17f8bbaf8e84f9ebe88c59f88b24babfac9b3; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 5ba64e4f3c4d4bc5007b7643d4efd6e1eaa059df; c53a8daf7e61e5b7dc15904c7bba0d14fdbf62dc; 3762b521d871d0adf90a35e0411ce861a4d14859; 379daa0dabeffa72b9a0d8c48b361236c03fb302; eba5ff9c61e59151bf1cce02ae0b4c87afd39572; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; ccd1282aea3cc7c3d40300d82472fc5f9f54cb8e; 5f19485b89af683b5b3130527892fcc1787fa8eb; e17529924798975856310a75cb3df3066ac7ccfa; 83e9565cede81b2b88a9fa241833135da142f4d3; ca1d23be869380ac9e900578c601c2d1febcc0c9; e5da4874c96cd0e00bc213c099cc028515e872fe; dc7d03d05a437aaf0cc02a4ed36339cc259d2583,,,
3f56f10adba8be5b249feb3e7d6bddddd1014d63,Pattern and process in the biogeography of subterranean amphipods,"The comparative data from studies of two â€˜superfamilyâ€™ groups with large numbers of subterranean taxa, the exclusively freshwater Crangonyctoidea and the predominately marine Hadzioidea, support the hypothesis that distributional patterns and evolutionary processes of stygobiont amphipods are closely linked and that the former can be a useful indicator of the latter. Three major biogeographic patterns are indicated by the distribution of subterranean species in these groups, each apparently reflecting a particular mode of origin: (1) freshwater stygobionts (limnostygobionts) derived from epigean freshwater ancestors through colonizations probably influenced by adaptive shifts, or assisted by stream capture and spring failure; (2) freshwater stygobionts derived from marine/brackish water ancestors by stranding during regression of marine embayments; and (3) marine/brackish water stygobionts (thalassostygobionts) derived from epigean marine/brackish water ancestors through adaptive shifts possibly in concert with fluctuating sea levels.ZusammenfassungVergleichende Untersuchungen zweier Superfamilien, jede mit einer grossen Anzahl unterirdischer Taxa, die ausschiesslich im SÃ¼sswasser verbreiteten Crangonyctoidea und die vorwiegend marinen Hadzioidea, stÃ¼tzen die Hypothese, dass Verbreitungsmuster und phylogenetische Prozesse stygobionter Amphipoden eng miteinander verbunden sind, und dass Erstere ein nÃ¼tzlicher Indikator fÃ¼r Letztere sind. Die Verbreitung unterirdischer Arten in dieser Gruppe weist auf drei biogeographische Muster hin, von denen jedes eine bestimmte Herkunft reflecktiert: (1) SÃ¼sswasser-Stygobionten (Limnostygobionten) kÃ¶nnen durch Kolonisation, wahrscheinlich beeinflusst durch VerÃ¤nderungen in der Anpassung, aus epigÃ¤ischen SÃ¼sswasser-Vorfahren hergeleitet werden, oder unterstÃ¼tzt durch â€˜stream captureâ€™ and â€˜spring failureâ€™ (Versiegen von Quellen); (2) SÃ¼sswasser-Stygobionten stammen von marinen/Brackwasser-Vorfahren ab, welche im Verlauf der marinen Regression â€˜gestrandetâ€™ sind: und (3) marine/Brackwasser-Stygobionten (Thalassostygobionten) enstammen epigÃ¤ischen marinen/Brackwasser-Vorfahren durch VerÃ¤nderungen in der Anpassung in Zusammenhang mit WasserstandsÃ¤nderungen.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""John R.

This study aimed to integrate the TERT promoter mutation status, MGMT promoter methylation status, MRI-derived features, and clinical features into a survival analysis model to better understand adult primary glioblastoma prognosis-related markers.


METHOD
A total of 304 adult glioblastoma samples collected after surgical resection were selected for retrospective analysis, and Sanger sequencing was performed to detect IDH and TERT promoter mutations. The methylation of the MGMT promoter was analyzed by pyrosequencing, and MRI-derived and clinical features were dichotomized into easily acquired variables. Random survival forest analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression, and LASSO regression were performed for the survival analysis, and ROC analysis and Pearson's chi-squared test were employed for the correlation analysis.


RESULTS
Wild-type IDH was present in 89.8% of the adult glioblastoma samples, and TERT promoter mutations and MGMT promoter methylation were observed in 66.42% and 38.49% of all adult primary glioblastomas, respectively. Age and MGMT promoter methylation were identified as independent prognostic biomarkers, and the TERT promoter mutation status and MGMT promoter methylation status, when combined with other tumor-related factors, generated several different survival subgroups. None of the factors investigated in this study predicted the MGMT promoter status, and MRI-detected necrosis was positively associated with TERT promoter mutations.


CONCLUSION

006b10f111c599cda41198f641ff562c0167a85a,Development of hemorrhage identification model using non-invasive vital signs.,"OBJECTIVE
Early detection and timely management of bleeding is critical as failure to recognize physiologically significant bleeding is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many such instances are detected late, even in highly monitored environments, contributing to delay in recognition and intervention. We propose a non-invasive early identification model to detect bleeding events using continuously collected photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) waveforms.


APPROACH
Fifty-nine York pigs undergoing fixed-rate, controlled hemorrhage were involved in this study and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression-based early detection model was developed and tested using PPG and ECG derived features. The output of the early detection model was a risk trajectory indicating the future probability of bleeding.


MAIN RESULTS
Our proposed models were generally accurate in predicting bleeding with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% CI 0.87-0.92) and achieved the average time of 16.1 mins to detect 16.8% blood loss when a false alert rate of 1% was tolerated. Models developed on non-invasive data performed with similar discrimination and lead time to hemorrhage compared to models using invasive arterial blood pressure as monitoring data.


SIGNIFICANCE
A bleed detection model using only non-invasive monitoring performs as well as those using invasive arterial pressure monitoring.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Chen"", ids = ""3833612""); list(name = ""Joo Heung Yoon"", ids = ""3878641""); list(name = ""Michael R.

e302f7552e75ebecd5462b5d831c0d8f7f8462c6,Deepview: Virtual Disk Failure Diagnosis and Pattern Detection for Azure,"In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), virtual machines (VMs) use virtual hard disks (VHDs) provided by a remote storage service via the network. Due to separation of VMs and their VHDs, a new type of failure, called VHD failure, which may be caused by various components in the IaaS stack, becomes the dominating factor that reduces VM availability. The current state-of-the-art approaches fall short in localizing VHD failures because they only look at individual components. In this paper, we designed and implemented a system called Deepview for VHD failure localization. Deepview composes a global picture of the system by connecting all the components together, using individual VHD failure events. It then uses a novel algorithm which integrates Lasso regression and hypothesis testing for accurate and timely failure localization. We have deployed Deepview at Microsoft Azure, one of the largest IaaS providers. Deepview reduced the number of unclassified VHD failure events from tens of thousands to several hundreds. It unveiled new patterns including unplanned top-of-rack switch (ToR) reboots and storage gray failures. Deepview reduced the timeto-detection for incidents to under 10 minutes. Deepview further helped us quantify the implications of some key architectural decisions for the first time, including ToR switches as a single-point-of-failure and the computestorage separation.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qiao Zhang"", ids = ""11240451""); list(name = ""Guo Yu"", ids = ""48056614""); list(name = ""Chuanxiong Guo"", ids = ""145207202""); list(name = ""Yingnong Dang"", ids = ""34402895""); list(name = ""Nick Swanson"", ids = ""46858142""); list(name = ""Xinsheng Yang"", ids = ""3029585""); list(name = ""Randolph Yao"", ids = ""22736499""); list(name = ""Murali Chintalapati"", ids = ""22795910""); list(name = ""Arvind Krishnamurthy"", ids = ""144695691""); list(name = ""Thomas E.

However, real-time monitoring of animal growth through traditional weighing scales is stressful for animals, costly and labor-intensive. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: 1) assess the predictive quality of an automated computer vision system used to predict BW and average daily gain (ADG) in beef cattle; and 2) compare different predictive approaches, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Artificial Neutral Networks (ANN). A total of 234 images of Nellore beef cattle were collected during the weaning, stocker and feedlot phases. First, biometric body measurements of each animal, such as body volume, area, length, and others, were performed using three-dimensional images captured with the KinectÂ® sensor, and their respective BW were acquired using an electronic scale. Next, the biometric measurements were used as explanatory variables in the four predictive approaches (MLR, LASSO, PLS, and ANN). To evaluate prediction quality, a leave-one-out cross-validation was adopted. The ANN was the best prediction approach in terms of Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) and squared predictive correlation (r2). The results for Weaning were RMSEPÂ =Â 8.6Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.91; for Stocker phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 11.4Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.79; and for Beginning of feedlot, RMSEPÂ =Â 7.7Â kg and r2Â =Â 0.92. The ANN was also the best method for prediction of ADG, with RMSEPÂ =Â 0.02Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.67 for the period between Weaning and Stocker, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.02Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.85 for the Weaning and Beginning of Feedlot phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.03Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.80 for Weaning and Final of Feedlot phase, RMSEPÂ =Â 0.10Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.51 for Stocker and Beginning of feedlot phase, and RMSEPÂ =Â 0.09Â kg/d and r2Â =Â 0.82 for the Beginning and Final of feedlot phase. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed automated computer vision system can be successfully used to predict BW and ADG in real-time in beef cattle.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Alexandre Cominotte"", ids = ""87517745""); list(name = ""Arthur F.

d1c8dff1e5d1d4081d5a60ca00595c69ffba2836,A Method of Estimating the [Î±/Fe] Ratios from Low-resolution Stellar Spectratwo,"Abstract A method for the determination of [Î±/Fe] from low-resolution stellar spectra is presented. The proposed scheme includes the following three steps: firstly, the spectrum is decomposed by the multi-scale Haar wavelet, and the high-frequency components are removed to suppress the high-frequency noise; then, based on the correlation of the spectral data component with [Î±/Fe], the spectral features are selected by the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) algorithm; finally, [Î±/Fe] is measured by the multiple linear regression method based on the MARCS stellar spectrum library. The effectiveness of the method is verified with the low-resolution stellar spectra of ELODIE, SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope), and four star clusters. The systematic deviations and accuracies are as follows: (0.04Â dex, 0.064Â dex) for the 317 ELODIE spectra; (0.16Â dex, 0.065Â dex) for the 412 SDSS spectra; (0.05Â dex, 0.062Â dex) for the 1276 LAMOST spectra (with the signal-noise ratio in the g band (SNRG) greater than 20). The averages of [Î±/Fe] obtained for the likely members of the globular star clusters (M13, M15) and open star clusters (NGC2420, M67) are in agreement with the literature values.",2019,Physics,"list(name = ""Lu Yu"", ids = ""151178056""); list(name = ""Li Xiang-ru"", ids = ""30993920""); list(name = ""Lin Yang-tao"", ids = ""1412547943""); list(name = ""Qiu Kaibin"", ids = ""107837127"")",,,Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics,43,237-251

f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f,Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters,"We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter Î¸_0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters Î·_0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for Î·_0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate Î·_0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating Î·_0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of Î¸_0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of Î·_0 into estimating equations for Î¸_0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N^(-1/2) consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest Î¸_0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate Î¸_0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N^(-1/2)-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Victor Chernozhukov"", ids = ""26331346""); list(name = ""Denis Chetverikov"", ids = ""88741529""); list(name = ""Mert Demirer"", ids = ""88741890""); list(name = ""Esther Duflo"", ids = ""2259683""); list(name = ""Christian Hansen"", ids = ""144613163""); list(name = ""Whitney Newey"", ids = ""3646527""); list(name = ""James M.

c127f280e9f27ef5e804dbcfed848cde920340a4,A note on accuracy of Bayesian LASSO regression in GWS,"Abstract Several genome wide selection (GWS) statistical methods have been proposed in the last years, and among these stands out the Bayesian LASSO (BL), which is a penalized regression method based on the regularization parameter (Î») estimates. In general, the posterior mean values for Î» are those that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) while controlling the L1 norm (absolute values) of the regression coefficients. However, another option is to use fixed values of Î», which is independent of this minimization process. Nevertheless, the most important aim of GWS is to make predictions about genomic breeding values (GBVÂ =Â u) for individuals that have not been measured directly for the trait, and for this reason the parameter to maximize should be the accuracy ( r u , u Ë† ). Thus, a question can arise as to whether such estimated Î» values that minimize RSS are the same as that which maximize r u , u Ë† . In order to answer this question, this paper aims to provide methodological and computational resources in order to evaluate the influence of BL regularization parameter estimates on the correlation between true and estimated GBV (accuracy) depending on genetic structure of the target trait (few or many QTLs and low or medium heritability). In general, it is possible to report, on average, that GBV prediction is robust in relation to the Î» estimation, since the different values for Î» lead to similar accuracy values. Moreover, the fixed Î» values grid request high computational costs, implying that the random Î» method is more attractive, since it is much faster to use just one Gibbs sampler run, while the grid must to use one run for each fixed Î» value.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Fabyano Fonseca Silva"", ids = ""2820472""); list(name = ""Luis Varona"", ids = ""144409528""); list(name = ""Marcos Deon Vilela Resende"", ids = ""145749592""); list(name = ""JÃºlio SÃ­lvio de Sousa Bueno Filho"", ids = ""102380135""); list(name = ""Guilherme J.

0d6715ec3c8f775f182b70283e5330072313300c,Implementing genomic selection in sour passion fruit population,"Sour passion fruit is an economically important tropical fruit crop with little explored genetic potential. This study aimed to provide breeders with essential estimates of genomic breeding values in economically important traits in passion fruit, using Bayesian models which may contribute to the implementation of Genomic Selection and develop new strategies for the continuity of sour passion fruit breeding programs. For this, the following Bayesian models were tested using 183 polymorphic marks: Bayesian Ridge regression, Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes B2, Bayes CÏ€ and Bayesian Lasso for estimation of genomic breeding values. To achieve this, ninety-five full-sib progenies derived from the third cycle of recurrent selection of the sour passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims.) at Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiroâ€”UENF were used and eight fruit yield (number of fruit, total yield, mean fruit weight, fruit length, fruit width) and quality(percent pulp, skin thickness, soluble solids) traits were assessed. The Bayes CÏ€ (smaller deviance information criterion) yield the best genetic predictions for almost all traits. Genetic correlations in this study indicate that the number of fruit can be used as a proxy for yield. The values of genomic heritability obtained were high and ranged from 0.62 to 0.76 and predict accuracy ranged from 0.55 to 0.75, so we can to speculate that the use of two replicates in the present study was an adequate amount to obtain phenotypic mean, which was used to adjust the genomic prediction model.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Alexandre Pio Viana"", ids = ""6169043""); list(name = ""Fernando Higino Lima e Silva"", ids = ""146723601""); list(name = ""Leonardo Siqueira GlÃ³ria"", ids = ""39832099""); list(name = ""Rodrigo Moreira Ribeiro"", ids = ""47073498""); list(name = ""Willian Krause"", ids = ""148349349""); list(name = ""Marcela Santana Bastos Boechat"", ids = ""8183510"")",6407f4c6fbadb26753a552cc486f30244b9f6810; 5479739e96487e7315032f74a2d3996a3c7be253; bf3e14c23068ba3a8b8216f515edaa621ecdba68; ba553933bd56b803e5028688a9b3711229e965dc,785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 8a9260489d11c73d4a20a31b77d5d1a5f8ecc1ce; e2230cc290b43777d5f0b09b2ce7de7ba55e2fd0; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 906f437217f8b3a06761b63236b8a95ce0601bc2; a1f4501e45a3c213d685711a6aed12afbcf5567e; 9d6e0fa2365a466a454fc69170d3055b88c55e57; c897a62c5518be5427e33aaed0315a1b2bd72551; 82cd42482127b3707f1d6585d2d7b43c3c79db1e; bb374d11f71648c91c9b32e7361f0a9220e0b165; b75afdb5255412c3d749d72908f4220d49be97a0; 1c8aa5b42e0945eb7fc12b7ed976ad909887fb62; 702980358f9ad462b6b1fcee9420c124981eadb5; 850c0349287a3a86b6b1758858d17ce7dd70b2e9; 20ebc7585d6b26c79dcea2294ccf5db1054cce9d; e89ca5aaf7a6e792698c9c132ba3a34da92f9d4b; 6708a1962fc91b7d1e7cab52890456013c2b8ff3; 3c8e37924ef94861970b4f87e81500a397e36590; bc22b40efc045f4716158de8efdc236b76abf4e9; 8de0f4d3168750a2509a7ef72131e055aba4c674; 2e8650b01dd557ffb15113c795536ea7c6ab1088; c0f462ecf0040fc893cf21be25c97dda92ee3e59; dfd5666f48518b5f5fe0317243f0441ca7b79c5f; 8ed93abc38431ae0bcfc15240d724ebd61481d06; cb8202c3189cce0908a721e59f049438db8654c2; 6cee1e132d614de8bcf3243745a5b50e6e982d71; 9a3adeee5ed9ec5615adb1f1e7471d6c0ad3be13; 7fabdce54467e3eb94f418fcfcd243fef09ac115; 53be35acc20c053b91ae34e292127e967f2d5359; 10a101dea23ce99ac2a6afb64702a745b9490eb0,Euphytica,213,1-13
960d452dae625f1db086c0d67e170b60510a4790,Preface,"Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of â€œBig Dataâ€ problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this areaâ€”The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)â€”was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESLâ€™s popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less technical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illustrating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or masterâ€™s students in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Francesc Comellas"", ids = ""1778181""); list(name = ""Robert ElsÃ¤sser"", ids = ""9343902""); list(name = ""Dragan Stevanovic"", ids = ""47706154"")",,,Discret.

db0351689bbc6a5f026bed187057c9ec270061aa,Comprehensive Proteomic Profilingâ€“derived Immunohistochemistry-based Prediction Models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutation-related Breast Carcinomas,"Heredity, mostly due to BRCA germline mutations, is involved in 5% to 10% of all breast cancer cases. Potential BRCA germline mutation carriers may be missed following the current eligibility criteria for BRCA genetic testing. The purpose of this study was to, therefore, develop an immunohistochemistry-based model to predict likelihood of underlying BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in unselected female breast cancer patients. The study group consisted of 100 BRCA1-related, 46 BRCA2-related, and 94 sporadic breast carcinomas. Tumor expression of 44 proteins involved in (BRCA-related) breast carcinogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry. A prediction model for BRCA-related versus nonâ€“BRCA-related breast cancer was developed using Lasso logistic regression analysis with cross-validation. The model was assessed for its discriminative value and clinical usefulness. The optimal prediction model included 14 predictors (age, cyclinD1, ER&agr;, ER&bgr;, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, GLUT1, IGFR, Ki67, mitotic activity index, MLH1, p120, and TOP2A), showed excellent discriminative performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.943; 95% confidence interval=0.909-0.978), and reasonable calibration. To enhance possible implementation, we developed an alternative model only considering more widely available immunostains. This model included 15 predictors (age, BCL2, CK5/6, CK8/18, cyclinD1, E-cadherin, ER&agr;, HER2, Ki67, mitotic activity index , MLH1, p16, PMS2, PR, and vimentin), and still showed very good discriminative performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.853; 95% confidence interval=0.795-0.911). We present a well-applicable and accurate tool to predict which breast cancer patients may have an underlying BRCA germline mutation, largely consisting of immunohistochemical markers independent of clinical characteristics.

3bf09837ba33002ab3b626ccee79da39ae30fe80,Predictive ability of genomic selection models for breeding value estimation on growth traits of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei,"Genomic selection (GS) can be used to accelerate genetic improvement by shortening the selection interval. The successful application of GS depends largely on the accuracy of the prediction of genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). This study is a first attempt to understand the practicality of GS in Litopenaeus vannamei and aims to evaluate models for GS on growth traits. The performance of GS models in L. vannamei was evaluated in a population consisting of 205 individuals, which were genotyped for 6 359 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers by specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) and phenotyped for body length and body weight. Three GS models (RR-BLUP, BayesA, and Bayesian LASSO) were used to obtain the GEBV, and their predictive ability was assessed by the reliability of the GEBV and the bias of the predicted phenotypes. The mean reliability of the GEBVs for body length and body weight predicted by the different models was 0.296 and 0.411, respectively. For each trait, the performances of the three models were very similar to each other with respect to predictability. The regression coefficients estimated by the three models were close to one, suggesting near to zero bias for the predictions. Therefore, when GS was applied in a L. vannamei population for the studied scenarios, all three models appeared practicable. Further analyses suggested that improved estimation of the genomic prediction could be realized by increasing the size of the training population as well as the density of SNPs.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Quanchao Wang"", ids = ""49110304""); list(name = ""Yang Yu"", ids = ""144971697""); list(name = ""Fuhua Li"", ids = ""7280046""); list(name = ""Xiaojun Zhang"", ids = ""47957729""); list(name = ""Jianhai Xiang"", ids = ""144731046"")",5f659b84a00f405f41014f9439ec4262cc919444; 361ccaaccf34b880da8e38bb1e6c3ac099edf016; 86a805a0304aef0193924d9cb970bcc69c7a8275; 77c4dae277edeaad8aae8995e4383274a08a2a6f; d7cff3d7cb8e99390cc53ac43177d8a0494af244,3f9664f8a7108957790de0ea5aa896b0143e8de3; dc965cec5e17db39602a8924eb1dcfc8af894d74; 02bd05cae947ecb56f99acb706b1ce83ccb7855f; d2b6c9aafd5e40b19ca72a6ea4b63381a907fa21; 6d718b70302530ffa1783054ca5de8748ccae75d; df4349c09be042a699f0b96c840576513dba2c6c; 9b39a9ee4a985a87519f7a9c24b2bb3450d4ca28; 7bc408a8c550d13f6b6874578681f7bf715743c6; 1a3fec35b6a97fd2b298dbdad92a404ce3421861; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 8de0f4d3168750a2509a7ef72131e055aba4c674; 16c396e48643eb7c6f090a4ffe7f8618c1290e5c; 6e263a4c1af5c762f928d665ac3400db7f1cd28a; 8770cf90750a1edac539de4500e53768fa7fbf89; d7a3650c096f46bc4256e14fc770827744d20029; 4ea0fbf652cbf0756b024098b1d1751d57c4164b; 7bc405eb0ad561cd0f2b7af6008b734ea67ff215; 3c3df1cab451088d3317e930c4ff0d396d2cbdb8; 52fbe29192154d1b50e129f2561cb81de4e48537; 4ea5fabf46b62594ae0bfa61fa5d010f7bad5fab; 4ae0fcd2de115990418d4f8fbf6c1560ff3209b9; 6ab9d98325637c790eab5815c6451f8f0d6e88fb; ecb54f3195426ba0e148ac4bce915ff974f53076; 4276276bb6662e9c52c863ac93ca6b54c92f092b; cbfba9b959dd77215331b096b774a8301b207c05; a543347de2ab10e191a1130c04d88e012f4bca21; a6de649d601e79c0f2971918bcc62abc861fa205; 068f3bca71be63c78e670835426351546f2486d1; 3c8e37924ef94861970b4f87e81500a397e36590; 3a190a1381ffa6ca2ef4ff2caa947a84469078cd; 7bc099b8460c396a626a786d2943a1b74bc4ea0f; 5025748c3e2984a6288d2ced02cb018e4d1fb2b7; 7802319979b7e86a78374ef9efaee4e6d6292b82; 550b39d7b8170933855296008755fc6749b7d536; 1938dde5adcef0aa3dc5b084fdcd23a872f92cb8; a932b216e9ec269379ad4ec8a37323f3653c9c33; cfbf49de73f51c99f1c46e157ba04280c5f92d80; 7c748c1bea85b9d0112ce5f8504086cedc644c2e; 2036aa67458b5e1f4d6f84026c5fa653d326fd5e; 03e927612f2fa40469ed4bfdfe25032b44eab9fb; e05e1312133bcd23b3912ac5b48649ae6a0f2e6e; d3addf50f1a9d978e70c4eabdeab4bc05b3baab0; 5ac7a9790d5c23c87f023e23805685f26beaacc4; b16378fe48b21521ad200507f8efb269d9758327; d290c9b6448eb560ff233c981db18f84db6e57de; 830ee3b1bad4ab09913ed4ca6e5ebcfc6b8b0cb7; fc8349142d3607bd0989f6929068e3a1b42f8cc5; d7eca42b08cb7de296166e019828ba6df41c1ed4; 7cf7340f7e8503a1e63f2d9a9bd151cb99c55d45; 6308a12b76ba037d06bf9b3054616c92148cea03; 5d1b6841eb9d1350a1923f9a2da708fe51d58db9; c61e378c244020643944594ff4208ed20ce887ed; 82dd8486d834549f05950feca7d11291940ff254; fd3d5c7274dfb0e2deea25a21e5ebaf26feaca48; ff09115a822d735d742caba2111cf2a6bad1f77c,Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology,35,1221-1229
601349c0de7ced07e82fb42c932256d7b5b7ca91,Prediction of Recurrence in Cervical Cancer Using a Nine-lncRNA Signature,"Background and Objective
As a common cancer type in women, cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortalities word wide. Recent evidence has demonstrated the regulatory role of a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cervical cancer. Here, we aimed to identify new biomarkers that related with the recurrence through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.


Methods
Firstly, we collected online lncRNA expression data of cervical cancer patients which were divided into training, validation, and test set. Then we developed a nine-lncRNA signature from training set by conducting LASSO Cox regression model along with 10-fold cross validation. The prognostic value of this risk score was validated in all the three sets using Kaplan-Meier analysis, C-index, time-dependent ROC curves and dynamic AUC. Biological function of these lncRNAs in cervical cancer cells were evaluated by performing gene ontology biological process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways analysis.


Results
According to the results, a higher predict accuracy was observed in the nine-lncRNA signature than that of FIGO stage in all the three sets. Stratified analysis also demonstrated that the nine-lncRNA signature can predict the recurrence of cervical cancer within FIGO stage.

Clostridium difficile colitis (CDC) is a major health concern in the United States (US), with earlier reports demonstrating a rising incidence. Studies analyzing predictors for total colectomy and mortality after colectomy are limited by small numbers.


STUDY DESIGN
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2001 to 2010 was retrospectively reviewed for CDC trends, the associated colectomy and mortality rates. Patient and hospital variables were used in the LASSO algorithm for logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation to build a predictive model for colectomy requirement and mortality after colectomy. The association of colectomy day with mortality was also examined on multivariable logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
An estimated 2,773,521 discharges with a diagnosis of CDC were identified in the US over a decade. Colectomy was required in 19,374 cases (0.7%), with an associated mortality of 30.7%. Compared with the 2001 to 2005 period, the 2006 to 2010 period witnessed a 47% increase in the rate of CDC and a 32% increase in the rate of colectomies. The LASSO algorithm identified the following predictors for colectomy: coagulopathy (odds ratio [OR] 2.71), weight loss (OR 2.25), teaching hospitals (OR 1.37), fluid or electrolyte disorders (OR 1.31), and large hospitals (OR 1.18). The predictors of mortality after colectomy were: coagulopathy (OR 2.38), age greater than 60 years (OR 1.97), acute renal failure (OR 1.67), respiratory failure (OR 1.61), sepsis (OR 1.40), peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.39), and congestive heart failure (OR 1.25). Surgery more than 3 days after admission was associated with higher mortality rates (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.14; p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Clostridium difficile colitis is increasing in the US, with an associated increase in total colectomies. Mortality rates after colectomy remain elevated. Progression to colectomy and mortality thereafter are associated with several patient and hospital factors. Knowledge of these risk factors may help in risk-stratification and counseling.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wissam J.

7d6001dac41c5b8b7f138f68fe65599905ad967f,Stylized Facts on Price Formation on Corporate Bonds and Best Execution Analysis,"The goal of this paper is to establish a benchmark for transaction cost analysis in bond trading for retail investors. Investors can use this benchmark to improve decisions when requesting quotes from dealers on electronic platforms. This benchmark is constructed in two steps. The first step is to identify abnormal trades by approximating the market liquidity using different statistical regression methods: OLS, two-step LASSO and Elastic Net. The second step is to estimate the amplitude and the decay pattern of price impact using non-parametric methods. A key discovery is the price impact asymmetry between customer-buy orders and costumer sell orders: customer buy orders have a larger price impact than customer sell orders. We show that this asymmetry is statistically significant.",2019,Economics,"list(name = ""Xin Guo"", ids = ""49932515""); list(name = ""Charles-Albert Lehalle"", ids = ""46225603""); list(name = ""Renyuan Xu"", ids = ""81216601"")",,96047b6c6ac464db3bc9a4da772ba2edb3e77bcb; c6767eea24b5e93c562f78838ced56b41d8b18e3; 291825220920dbc85a8ea30aa621095a375efd60; 9d084f0847b899c383683f03089d06d2aed698e1; 809672c19835f14ed8d84cd25d1bc0c7c4f8f47f; 6e920cf083d9ab35ebb641f6848092bbb3af11e6; 00777edc168f26633de9f5b9ff4c4f74bd9790e3; 999431df0003af1a648d64d3ade032923b021380; efc553ccd69295da867476cdac5002e890603aec; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 5a3f2d798018ad3b9140a48134579f8e3ce47339; 4a24be000bffa7628877eb75a7ba23a4d0f56a8e; 9369ee5c839ffb2e7c37b0de479c5f0c517a93ba; cdce75fce91b52d2de9e5fd6542da4a41698c538; b45c22fa4db91e38e3d64c3d2a258a9aa931e330; db3b6345ca61b470812fe56cb5ce5c54258e1c0a; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 425f5f9de7d9b3bdb038acb8a6229b2402dea1ec; 436c714dc94928c33034094bad837bbf195b02b1; 0b41fd0d241a797764534a69b528ecf1d5c7bc73; f92f8f67b80087ebab35d21fc4b069ce85247216; 51c2004d0d7a3f35cdbe23796039d24c39fd5965; 5fd71158e32a4c15d71ee058b3268772fd7d31cf; 07c3796bdd0c8ace53b1576e4fb49d0cca2173c9; 892227905eb9c107dce0174b5ed0f88fdc844512; 65fb07755b37047b0effea4627b1305287fc7ae1; bd314d0b3780139315ef667021156a7f18191946; 50305fe006e8098ff36c8f2a606702a56bbffc76; 173b9836dfc8ec9bd8c863f5015f4cbb7b53c6d3; 4e48fe956939282d3203e4293f1e68ae96b9aab3; 60be4a6e41e69659002bceb8ba41efa5462a07c5; 5827ca4a5ac97e717fb5768f313079e813cebe86; 9f14e54eef3f327543e49bec9dbc2e0cab53f0b2; d0e643dfc8c9bd216efb219dc7de949afd70a786; 11424815b6718e461a75a928aadc8697fcb73132; 74a6c8ffb2995afce8adb5c8ef353402a914267d; a36b028d024bf358c4af1a5e1dc3ca0aed23b553; 5f6edc269fab6c955cfffa329a440db31cfe1f82; 89787e254029ad382a806d17294df0372218e5d0; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 6e17c5e91bce44147304f0db812aef6aa7b414aa,arXiv: Statistical Finance,,

b5a61c832a652fd4a90672b814477efa456eca7c,Variable selection via the grouped weighted lasso for factor analysis models,"The L1 regularization such as the lasso has been widely used in regression analysis since it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero, which leads to variable selection. We consider the problem of variable selection for factor analysis models via the L1 regularization procedure. In order to select variables each of which is controlled by multiple parameters, we treat parameters as grouped parameters and then apply the grouped lasso. Crucial issues in this modeling procedure include the selection of the number of factors and regularization parameters. Choosing these parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. We derive a model selection criterion for evaluating a factor analysis model via the grouped lasso. The proposed procedure produces estimates that lead to variable selection and also selects the number of factors objectively. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. A real data example is also given to illustrate our procedure.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kei Hirose"", ids = ""46638920""); list(name = ""Sadanori Konishi"", ids = ""3344419""); list(name = ""å»£ç\200¬ æ…§"", ids = ""67229516""); list(name = ""å°\217è¥¿ è²žå‰‡"", ids = ""70509692"")",307a59f11e469975c37795b3f1e5d7d2e8938af4; b23ff528ca77001d3d69b3bb46ed73e842f0a0c1; 572782b0f564524058625803afd33ffb3a304168; 586755d53e6e7b190961a069d0f77e6710a64fab; a88782fcc380b561a766f0064d63fb6844d3552e; 8380f71953172e5add47fb9c782f28a875c101f0; f9a95b55c7c2080f0badaa4805cce81e511f97d1; 0dd3a067507254dd19b11b93e8025dcea33e88e8; efb98c5d406764b8da9941664b2713577507ced7; cbdbeb6ecbf2f19f8e1ec005890c2a00b83327fa; 3ad33326038ea0e91265acc238ff8c76ca49a845,6ed6ae2095d73ea83301b7431e4c8962502e41d6; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; cdae5f5e5b16cefa4ed72ebf84e517c5b83b3d3c; d94572ef9d922f486203f1cf171680d32c377f39; e004bb1488e78d0011d450166b81580a9b05ea3f; 8f4abd382994073ab993279d7d94ef0a890c1791; 7bb5150feb85fe561a9807ead1a9a7838061816e; 275db1c79e17a1811fc95044daaa679264f83f1b; a5520c1d3d9cc9afafe4c19cd5128a11667f6f94; 1ae38056ec6a49637d2f4599fc9efc7e455243d2; 7770ec5639b25dc30c0a4b8445b2065ec8d9ff45; f914f47082f31fb82e190388b153fc1f6cf401b4; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; bcf16685fb1a401dbbbe2892af251cc887baacd4; ea56e6fbdaede4071a5ad4de8c4c1f9d052e77b0; b122a1392646319dad8b0dd35329c211317daf25; 8d7259ad2cacdec7701213a9df7ec0ff3e42bbcc; 0cf9f9221afdb73db4c27cf9f548473b8c7157f0; efcaab3da9c1514b21cd68cbacbf656daee9b456; 153dc36f5182d683e564e951aa551f476fa9981c; d4614d558f49c1fc5db2b4b7f908a94c96fd0ac4; d4783d05ae9dd82a53883d33a767ef4ab0af789b; 667c3d02c39801137502b233f623688b8fa71c34; fb0b812d9ba1a4b33f399fd51b56693e1935c745; 2f3ce8002d531a5edc85bbdfcb7e1512a0275152; 86ff6ad944a20469b8c42b404b7b5966a03e9ea6; 225766624f05c3bfc5bbb55ad449dcc4f9722c67; 0c9976a0360654b4508a8dc78d039ab73b32d57f; 9791f406c8deedb80c3d5231f8402108cd3a07aa; 207b102d57b4d925a8bd5744304716e85671580a; 88b93d713e90a15f03bcff0a3c921aa19b5d9f1f; 99c0b8f60892d67015c0ffdd3170daafb5702ea4; 8786794fedda50a673ec5e94e35471ad29190bdf; 20ee62fdb890dc390f2b7b43a1bf88ed2d3be2f7; 05bff38c6a5a47618fa6fb3678be432408c56886; 5e9222ee44916c976c80f11303002e850de0c63e; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 35b36ee0071ec1b9b6b1e08f8c174e4796256202; 326e776d470352c93b21b734f00e5837c8d68eb4; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 5286e4ff1c74c41079f637a59bf77ec21b441262; 7cfd929e670c5236dfa1aa8adfc841326c96e5c0; b250949ed587933a32f87fe1a939a530e61b8fa2; 118e5ed3529f62656f8266b2aa9eb4fb9ddb95f3; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; d050c9d868f1fbe705b0922db9e829b32f7ad39c; 73ce149073c69655a02ea512a8ad411d86b7e185; 7db6ab436856581af1cd2c22935dbc941a9fce02; 16aaba6af4dee34d4e492c21af408021c704a509; 1a3d1c85060bb5a3e9f4a70f30ca1feb20e36cf7; ff0afdc737036506f32625334261b83b513f4cb5; c0215ec06048f9f9b2e02c2923c2f01f1d2cc731; 47126bcd61fff79469fc5888e5f37c96262409e5; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; b1288679aec7498f1e545e979a8023634bad6eae; e2f42036271ed5d740c83ba3b8c409fa1a702e84; 4a88479c0c47dfa13a683af0f40d49f0ebc73dee; d055308302571d6721895c8944a9027df958d8cf; b78df541e9fe8cdb633df764becc379ee4ad88e3,MI Preprint Series,,
ef5701299f75a8658e19d791f40302cabd8b8b9c,Income Bipolarization and Poverty: Evidence from Rural Nigeria,"The disappearance of the middle class- income bipolarization could result into tension and social conflict. If such conflict starts in the rural area, the possible resulting revolts would clog the wheel of economic production and policy implementation and there is possibility of spreading to the urban area. The study therefore estimated income bipolarization in the rural area of Nigeria from 1980 to 2004 using Foster-Wolfson -FW- (1994) and Lasso de le Vega and Urrutia - LU- (2006) indices. Bipolarization linked poverty was estimated for the periods through the later and Foster-Wolfson bipolarization estimates were linked with the poverty status and other socio-economic features of the rural households by tobit regression analysis. Bipolarization was found to be on reduction from 1992 to 2004 moving in the direction of poverty level. FW Bipolarization was 0.6125, 0.4067, 0.4775, 0.4108 and 0.3529 in 1980, 1985, 1992, 1996 and 2004 while LU Bipolarization was 0.1676, 0.1430, 0.1610, 0.1460 and 0.1383 for the same years respectively. Poverty has highest significant positive effect on bipolarization with a marginal effect of 0.02520. The marginal effects of age was 0.00014, female head households was 0.00119. Household size, father's education, mother education, married status, farming and wage employment have significant negative marginal effects of 0.00037, 0.00027, 0.00013, 0.00636, 0.000697 and 0.00105 respectively. Income bipolarization is higher among households located in the South than their base category, the north. Poverty and its covariates have higher sum total interactive positive effect on bipolarization than their base categories, the non-poor covariates. There is need to reduce poverty for bipolarization to decline. The southern part needs more attention in bipolarization reduction strategies. All variables that reduce poverty like education would have to be harnessed further to reduce bipolarization to guide against the occurrence of its consequences. (Oluwole I. Ogunyemi & Omobowale A.

afaaff02cb34f8bdb64c61faa8d2ae400c1435ed,High-Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Distribution Estimation with Local Privacy,"High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from a large number of users may produc3 rich knowledge for our society but also bring unprecedented privacy threats to participants. Recently differential privacy has been proposed as an effective means to mitigate privacy concerns. However, existing work on differential privacy suffers from the ""curse of high-dimensionality"" (data with multiple attributes) and high scalability (data with large scale records). Moreover, traditional methods of differential privacy were achieved via aggregation results, which cannot guarantee local privacy for distributed users in crowdsourced systems. To deal with these issues, in this paper we propose a novel scheme that can efficiently estimate multivariate joint distribution for high-dimensional data with local privacy. On the client side, we employ randomized response techniques to locally transform data from distributed users into privacy-preserving bit strings, which can prevent potential inside privacy attacks in crowdsourced systems. On the server side, the crowdsourced bit strings are aggregated for multivariate distribution estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multivariate version of the expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of high dimensional data. To speed up the performance, unlike the EM-based method that needs to scan each user's bit string, we propose to use Lasso regression to obtain the distribution estimation from the aggregation information only once, which can significantly reduce the computation time for multivariate distribution estimation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our multivariate distribution estimation scheme over existing estimation schemes.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xuebin Ren"", ids = ""2235386""); list(name = ""Chia-Mu Yu"", ids = ""2015326""); list(name = ""Weiren Yu"", ids = ""37790069""); list(name = ""Shusen Yang"", ids = ""35829779""); list(name = ""Xinyu Yang"", ids = ""2595119""); list(name = ""Julie A.

bb5fee706f131511540f12cb8e9bdae47e03fce1,Discriminating between positional and non-positional obstructive sleep apnea using some clinical characteristics,"PurposeThe primary objective of this paper was to identify significant factors associated with positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA) and to provide a clinical tool for discriminating non positional from POSA. Secondary objectives were about estimating the prevalence of POSA, comparing the polysomnographic variables across POSA and non-POSA patients.MethodsThis was a cross sectional study on 278 patients who completed an overnight sleep study for OSA assessment. Patients were aged over 18Â years, without central sleep apnea or narcolepsy and slept no less than 20Â min in a non-supine position. POSA was defined as a total apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥5 and a ratio supine AHI/non-supine AHI â‰¥2. The binary logistic regression was used for modeling the likelihood for OSA patient to be positional, and the LASSO method was used for selecting the optimal set of clinical characteristics associated with POSA.ResultsOverall, 53% of patients had POSA. These patients were younger (pÂ =Â 0.005), had lower BMI (pÂ <Â 0.0001), lower prevalence of hypertension (pÂ =Â 0.006), lower Berlin (pÂ =Â 0.01), and lower STOP (pÂ =Â 0.001) scores compared to non-POSA patients.

e9dd2bf2bd08fb076902641d42300f5f5cad01cb,Application of penalized linear regression methods to the selection of environmental enteropathy biomarkers,"BackgroundEnvironmental Enteropathy (EE) is a subclinical condition caused by constant fecal-oral contamination and resulting in blunting of intestinal villi and intestinal inflammation. Of primary interest in the clinical research is to evaluate the association between non-invasive EE biomarkers and malnutrition in a cohort of Bangladeshi children. The challenges are that the number of biomarkers/covariates is relatively large, and some of them are highly correlated.MethodsMany variable selection methods are available in the literature, but which are most appropriate for EE biomarker selection remains unclear. In this study, different variable selection approaches were applied and the performance of these methods was assessed numerically through simulation studies, assuming the correlations among covariates were similar to those in the Bangladesh cohort. The suggested methods from simulations were applied to the Bangladesh cohort to select the most relevant biomarkers for the growth response, and bootstrapping methods were used to evaluate the consistency of selection results.ResultsThrough simulation studies, SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation), Adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and MCP (Minimax Concave Penalty) are the suggested variable selection methods, compared to traditional stepwise regression method. In the Bangladesh data, predictors such as mother weight, height-for-age z-score (HAZ) at week 18, and inflammation markers (Myeloperoxidase (MPO) at week 12 and soluable CD14 at week 18) are informative biomarkers associated with childrenâ€™s growth.ConclusionsPenalized linear regression methods are plausible alternatives to traditional variable selection methods, and the suggested methods are applicable to other biomedical studies. The selected early-stage biomarkers offer a potential explanation for the burden of malnutrition problems in low-income countries, allow early identification of infants at risk, and suggest pathways for intervention.Trial registrationThis study was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01375647, on June 3, 2011.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Miao Lu"", ids = ""50654942""); list(name = ""Jianhui Zhou"", ids = ""48128651""); list(name = ""Caitlin Naylor"", ids = ""5844781""); list(name = ""Beth D.

f7509cb345c0c59440856319769da2dec8b9bedd,Dual Lasso Selector,"We consider the problem of model selection and estimation in sparse high dimensional linear regression models with strongly correlated variables. First, we study the theoretical properties of the dual Lasso solution, and we show that joint consideration of the Lasso primal and its dual solutions are useful for selecting correlated active variables. Second, we argue that correlations among active predictors are not problematic, and we derive a new weaker condition on the design matrix, called Pseudo Irrepresentable Condition (PIC). Third, we present a new variable selection procedure, Dual Lasso Selector, and we prove that the PIC is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistent variable selection for the proposed method. Finally, by combining the dual Lasso selector further with the Ridge estimation even better prediction performance is achieved. We call the combination (DLSelect+Ridge), it can be viewed as a new combined approach for inference in high-dimensional regression models with correlated variables. We illustrate DLSelect+Ridge method and compare it with popular existing methods in terms of variable selection, prediction accuracy, estimation accuracy and computation speed by considering various simulated and real data examples.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Niharika Gauraha"", ids = ""3386799"")",06ee48ba94b8d9457b0b1446c46fbb41bfc999c3,aedf452469b3babc395a7d3071eee564eff7e4f5; 719b9c058234bd41aa9df83ac016f8cc122d8072; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; 7a2af6871286b7e31162a088c4122c49043bfd65; 109974f8eee235de94ed270a1cc4bb3deff6d78c; 104a0d6e3eccfd3b4dedcb89e75fdda617d8d38a; 533915d922c64903e4a4013a78ec03b91f522fc5; 714cb770ac83f42fc41a16cc846e31da817678b0; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 4004fe098dd8b575d742aaffc021a6af319198b8; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; 6a870a2d9bbbc4067b28ee6105e754e7c3502af0; c6eed218239ae13202f2b00c3a3caf49cc71d9ba; 7adbaea0b1987e3f4b8e39929f7057e1f03560d5; 4f0df00d0fa9f7d93d4c86dc21a6cc523addefd0; a0d9de0c285d40c1a2b29d843e1ee99f15e30898; db31973871f5648cffb02e7590582376e16ad0bb; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 729e51f842eff9f1f934b4e3065488f3650869ad; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 8d6081993c9a65f333597582e6b60e7ab593b8ac; 46ce914dc60f17d37334a32b6a93d3e15bad743b; d503f974d1dcbb94264def2e11da63c9f746a629; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6,arXiv: Applications,,
280552d460aa70570ec51e15e33da2b6ab603426,Temporal Gut Microbial Changes Predict Recurrent Clostridium difficile in Patients with and without Ulcerative Colitis,"Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) carries an increased risk of primary and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and CDI is associated with UC flares. We hypothesized that specific fecal microbial changes associate with UC flare and rCDI. Methods We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 57 patients with UC and CDI, CDI only, and UC flare only. Stool samples were collected at baseline, at the end of antibiotic therapy, and after reconstitution for 16S rRNA sequencing. The primary outcomes were recurrent UC flare and rCDI. Logistic regression and Lasso models were constructed for analysis. Results There were 21 (45.7%) patients with rCDI, while 11 (34.4%) developed UC flare. Patients with rCDI demonstrated significant inter-individual (P=.008) and intra-individual differences (P=.004 relative to baseline samples) in community structure by Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) compared with non-rCDI. Two cross-validated models identified by Lasso regression predicted risk of rCDI: a baseline model with female gender, hospitalization for UC in the past year, increased Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobia, and decreased Eubacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonellaceae (AuROC=0.94); and a model 14 days after completion of antibiotics with female gender, increased Shannon diversity, Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased community richness and Faecalibacterium (AuROC=0.9). Adding JSD between baseline and post-treatment samples to the latter model improved fit (AuROC=0.94). A baseline model including UC hospitalization in the past year and increased Bacteroidetes showed good fit characteristics for predicting increased risk of UC flare (AuROC=0.88). Conclusion Fecal microbial features at baseline and following therapy predict rCDI risk in patients with and without UC. These results may help risk stratify patients to guide management.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Allen Lee"", ids = ""145131979""); list(name = ""Krishna Rao"", ids = ""152334848""); list(name = ""Julajak Limsrivilai"", ids = ""48437284""); list(name = ""Merritt G Gillilland"", ids = ""8840134""); list(name = ""Benjamin J.
