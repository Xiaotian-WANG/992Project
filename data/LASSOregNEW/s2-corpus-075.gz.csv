89d7f2aacd061bf0678c412a628cf468506675f5,Factorial Network Models To Improve P2P Credit Risk Management,"This paper investigates how to improve statistical-based credit scoring of SMEs involved in P2P lending. The methodology discussed in the paper is a factor network-based segmentation for credit score modeling. The approach first constructs a network of SMEs where links emerge from comovement of latent factors, which allows us to segment the heterogeneous population into clusters. We then build a credit score model for each cluster via lasso-type regularization logistic regression. We compare our approach with the conventional logistic model by analyzing the credit score of over 15000 SMEs engaged in P2P lending services across Europe. The result reveals that credit risk modeling using our network-based segmentation achieves higher predictive performance than the conventional model.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Daniel Felix Ahelegbey"", ids = ""70428266""); list(name = ""Paolo Giudici"", ids = ""152159268""); list(name = ""Branka Hadji-Misheva"", ids = ""1400931086"")",,143432fd1b31bdc61c16b37b296f4f33807bd392; 8b01452c236b375fcc482998e073bb3d557b2b31; db1cc2871884f1b89a00520b1bcc55bf54e93d32; f89be3aa29635b1e7f6c8bb40d9aa81acaf41fa5; 9dcd13ef4cf2809d7d0de4553d23132bd9b26ccd; 9f848af3f9592e4ac2c45277c69886bed35dc2ee; 90b66ac1946c681626f3a8e4096ad9391bcce7cc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 1672b0efe0f8b8b6e48570c884d5ba3f8a5d5fdc; a059b9d26eefa364a793d3df61ababa4de4b3786; b6915553e337bce29379a24262f16cc62b0ab0ee; 5a2ebab358547218215b3e47763ab6b5ff3b6794; 8488eae3f5b3ef13b9c186f2a619cc6275bc4c6e; c2c0053ee92bc770a9e93db14dbfee7e9f9ad799; a193120975be25b4ba2764e6d7bf9dc01588aafb; 8dffb9e8032f83d2f947f383df05e8288a30f4a3; 6eacd2545a7c567232cfa73d3c931ad0f385b349; 41f86885d93d33d6d22985398da424309c6e1e7f,,,
c7df028be2dff66931255e8c4f12d39567c598ff,Orthogonalizing Penalized Regression,"Since the penalized likelihood function of the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty is highly non-linear and has many local optima, finding a local solution to achieve the so-called oracle property is an open problem. We propose an iterative algorithm, called the OEM algorithm, to fill this gap. The development of the algorithm draws direct impetus from a missing-data problem arising in design of experiments with an orthogonal complete matrix. In each iteration, the algorithm imputes the missing data based on the current estimates of the parameters and updates a closed-form solution associated with the complete data. By introducing a procedure called active orthogonization, we make the algorithm broadly applicable to problems with arbitrary regression matrices. In addition to the SCAD penalty, the proposed algorithm works for other penalties like the MCP, lasso and nonnegative garrote. Convergence and convergence rate of the algorithm are examined. The algorithm has several unique theoretical properties. For the SCAD and MCP penalties, an OEM sequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations. For various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having grouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. For computing the ordinary least squares estimator with a singular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse-based least squares estimator.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shifeng Xiong"", ids = ""38693201""); list(name = ""Bin Dai"", ids = ""144065722""); list(name = ""Peter Z.

Despite high hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence, opioid use disorder (OUD) patients on methadone rarely engage in HCV treatment. We investigated the effectiveness of HCV management via telemedicine in an opioid substitution therapy (OST) program.


Methods
OUD patients on methadone underwent biweekly telemedicine sessions between a hepatologist and physician assistant during the entire HCV treatment course. All pretreatment labs (HCV RNA, genotype and noninvasive fibrosis assessments) were obtained onsite and direct acting antivirals were co-administered with methadone using modified directly observed therapy. We used multiple correspondence analysis, LASSO, and logistic regression to identify variables associated with pursuit of HCV care.


Results
Sixty-two HCV RNA-positive patients (24% HIV-infected, 61% male, 61% black/African-American, 25.8% Hispanic) were evaluated. All patients were stabilized on methadone and all except 4 were HCV genotype 1-infected. Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis was present in 34.5% of patients. Of the 45 treated patients, 42 (93.3%) achieved viral eradication. Of 17 evaluated patients who were not treated, 5 were discontinued from the drug treatment program or did not follow-up after the evaluation, 2 had HIV adherence issues, and 10 had insurance authorization issues. Marriage and a mental health diagnosis other than depression were the strongest positive predictors of treatment pursuit while being divorced, separated, or widowed was the strongest negative predictor.


Conclusion
HCV management via telemedicine integrated into an OST program is a feasible model with excellent virologic effectiveness. Psychosocial and demographic variables can assist in identification of subgroups with a propensity or aversion to pursue HCV treatment.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew H.

d5f1f2f942e8a5399c7352fbee77ee4ebe7d883d,Inferring Microbial Interactions from Metagenomic Time-series Using Prior Biological Knowledge,"Due to the recent advances in modern metagenomics sequencing methods, it becomes possible to directly analyze the microbial communities within human body. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact over time with the human body and the surrounding environment, a critical step is the inference of interactions among different microbes directly from sequencing data. However, metagenomics data is both compositional and highly dimensional in nature. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the interactions among various microbe species are needed to analyze such data. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Microbial Time-series Prior Lasso (MTPLasso) which integrates sparse linear regression with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature and cross-sectional metagenomics data. We show that MTPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of precision and recall rates, as well as the accuracy in inferring the interaction types. Finally, the interaction networks we infer from human gut data demonstrate credible results when compared against real data.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chieh Lo"", ids = ""144645869""); list(name = ""Radu Marculescu"", ids = ""1702532"")",2db4686d2324c8ad0250c68f721b588366dda203; 7a5c5118df5bd1caad90d49eb9d7a52bc23aff45; 36964c0cef3cbe40e6a8e07c8cab5ee2dc1cb706; 760cdec5f8655fe581497d5452e896da355c34f6,538b042c7287ab2159033189da776bbc7b434aae; dce8146987557735a19771aefa1f027211a2c275; 13cb9ae33a1ed494f9859afc8c98188bd3895fd3; b70a87a994def6765f9152432ca7267e5463c7b3; d0993707d34504c95448673f4591e94bef17fa55; b43b3c34f9d541afb803150c28df0e9ba783cb9d; 27e44e21b24856f0fbb1e94827eac98238e996ef; af741719135cd124243ce296ac52c87758fda71f; ae9bf4d0219ceb852f877db7dd82e080981dac2a; 84aac1ad5be349f50b54abe634a9d68d7ab894b6; 21252bf6982bf24238a9136697e1d08725380715; dd37a59ace2e7b13e455f2def7ac1d60cdb99d88; 8cf89fcd9908b23b37f8a4feec25e07ca009f91a; 554f51f321757a69bd67607fac79076a054ef693; 55318a821872bad70becafb6086474a56723257e; a39ab966881c616a89a0f392212f5275e99dba98; 5744934383e559c3264250915ef82156edb19db3; c4e528f2d59bbadb71e10802f24fe841165e4046; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; a83871aafe5b29f151a8646848ecb0ee8971b87d; 575029c06edbb2e1cc68b5a3c26c5d716d085215; 278de4c6a78364f4e9514166e5750352e7b5e250; a9a93a16a04742815ff89c0dcb8a2af898c09b71; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e,"Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics",,

c81f24e6b81c2bb5b3668b8b5626b95096096bcb,Role of m5C-related regulatory genes in the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies globally, and is frequently associated with a poor prognosis. 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a common epigenetic modification with many critical roles in eukaryotes. However, the expression and functional roles of m5C regulators are largely unknown. In this study, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine the expression, gene signatures, and prognostic values of m5C-related genes. We confirmed that the frequency of mutation events of m5C regulatory genes was high in HCC (35/363). Dysregulation of m5C-related genes was also associated with a higher HCC stage. Moreover, a strong relationship was found between the expression of m5C regulatory genes and HCC patient survival. High expression of NSUN4 and ALYREF correlated significantly with survival outcome. We developed a two-gene signature of m5C regulators with HCC prognostic value based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression models. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results indicated that high expression of NSUN4 was associated with methylation and demethylation processes. Meanwhile, high expression of ALYREF was clearly related to cell cycle regulation and mitosis. In conclusion, our results revealed that m5C-related genes play an essential role in tumor progression in HCC. Further detection of m5C methylation could provide a novel method for HCC targeted therapy.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuting He"", ids = ""9253595""); list(name = ""Xiao Yu"", ids = ""143677828""); list(name = ""Jie Li"", ids = ""145247630""); list(name = ""Qiyao Zhang"", ids = ""46324965""); list(name = ""Qingyuan Zheng"", ids = ""1621269793""); list(name = ""Wen-zhi Guo"", ids = ""47032744"")",,,American journal of translational research,12 3,"

787879fbb28f7d5b3dc37f98e653d379ae4dc626,Prediction Based on Mean Subset,"Shrinkage methods have traditionally been applied in prediction problems. In this article we develop a shrinkage method (mean subset) that forms an average of regression coefficients from individual subsets of the explanatory variables. A Bayesian approach is taken to derive an expression of how the coefficient vectors from each subset should be weighted. It is not computationally feasible to calculate the mean subset coefficient vector for larger problems, and thus we suggest an algorithm to find an approximation to the mean subset coefficient vector. In a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study, it is found that the proposed mean subset method has superior prediction performance than prediction based on the best subset method, and in some settings also better than the ridge regression and lasso methods. The conclusions drawn from the Monte Carlo study is corroborated in an example in which prediction is made using spectroscopic data.",2002,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Henrik Ã\230jelund"", ids = ""3446563""); list(name = ""Philip J.

We present `lasso with Gauss copula prior' and `lasso with t-copula prior.' The simulation study and real-world data for regression, classification, and large time-series data show that the `copula prior' often outperforms the lasso and elastic net while having a comparable sparsity of representation. Also, the copula prior encourages a grouping effect. The strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model collectively under the copula prior. The `copula prior' is a generic method, which can be used to define the new prior distribution. The application of copulas in modeling prior distribution for Bayesian methodology has not been explored much.

2d2f53a0083ca1110323717cb300c440495e7bb8,Learning Transportation Mode Choice for Context-Aware Services with Directed-Graph-Guided Fused Lasso from GPS Trajectory Data,"Mobility profiles of users play a crucial role in a wide range of context-aware computing and services. Travel mode choice, as a representative feature of mobility profiles, is one of the important components in travel demand and future planning of transportation systems. Transportation mode choice has been widely studied based on the random utility model and decision making methods which haven't considered the correlation among features influencing transportation mode choice. This paper presents a data driven model to analyze transportation mode choice given transportation information. The contributions of this paper lie in the following two aspects. On one hand, we propose a travel mode choice model considering the correlation among influencing features of mode. And the relevant features related to the mode choice are redefined and considered to improve the final efficiency and effectiveness. On the other hand, we propose a directed-graph-guided fused lasso method to depict the correlation rules among features. The lasso method can reduce the redundant information to improve the speed of convergence and accuracy of analysis. Three different models namely standard lasso, graph-guided fused lasso and spatio-functionally weighted regression based models, are compared with our model and tested with the GPS trajectory data in Beijing. As a result, we achieved better performance than other compared models.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xiaolu Zhu"", ids = ""40273250""); list(name = ""Jinglin Li"", ids = ""5781238""); list(name = ""Zhihan Liu"", ids = ""2280742""); list(name = ""Fangchun Yang"", ids = ""1716407"")",cd86dc5be0e430b7a1d019290867a2ae00e6c498; b9b1dbb6a5180b93dcc976e62f44de72e776b81b,111b1a0b41eb7d72c53433a144551f5031ee407a; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 69175f3746dab3b6f0a2a8a10aab0df8e5dd8ba6; c9534cd01e3a0b88f7ba908f11c1829c8996792d; d40ee5dd758c525dfb9932d726bb4e844b7b8478; 382377d99bf9e5826c15827d5ddf270153d73584; f7aa6b881d1a1c143b5de3d4a61722ca2049c5a5; dbca9fa1b74dd05abf40eebebececaf1dc7f15a1; f47c420a50120c81211d9b9e16600e8bbdf8fef1; a10809630199da3b7352ae790f013bba47d58211; ab20349a360133c1e234b9b6f0ac4090e5b17fd3; 8810f99253a7d846ea1353ecb136d7a9fc6670c0; e2dadf022253ea1c5570a81604460c3787962ded; c509e5b5eca48651b30fc29fad22ced4b29b6eec; 0c7cb11b3671cc04ed5ec6894536878d00eb8553; 467ab9dc550b9241d781c3bccdcc816be76f3197; 0a18e876a742062fbcbed47fdabf027d616cf34a; c4a6074b133d3f0ef147152993ef23247461fe9b,2017 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS),,692-699
f86d80a6d34f15d679ef391cdfca2f3fe0b42edf,Integrating Biological Knowledge Into Case-Control Analysis Through Iterated Conditional Modes/Medians Algorithm.,"Logistic regression is an effective tool in case-control analysis. With the advanced high throughput technology, a quest to seek a fast and efficient method in fitting high-dimensional logistic regression has gained much interest. An empirical Bayes model for logistic regression is considered in this article. A spike-and-slab prior is used for variable selection purpose, which plays a vital role in building an effective predictive model while making model interpretable. To increase the power of variable selection, we incorporate biological knowledge through the Ising prior. The development of the iterated conditional modes/medians (ICM/M) algorithm is proposed to fit the logistic model that has computational advantage over Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The implementation of the ICM/M algorithm for both linear and logistic models can be found in R package icmm that is freely available on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Simulation studies were carried out to assess the performances of our method, with lasso and adaptive lasso as benchmark. Overall, the simulation studies show that the ICM/M outperform the others in terms of number of false positives and have competitive predictive ability. An application to a real data set from Parkinson's disease study was also carried out for illustration. To identify important variables, our approach provides flexibility to select variables based on local posterior probabilities while controlling false discovery rate at a desired level rather than relying only on regression coefficients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vitara Pungpapong"", ids = ""1403573840""); list(name = ""Min Zhang"", ids = ""50495571""); list(name = ""Dabao Zhang"", ids = ""2553667"")",,,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,,
8030014b5164fbadd303dee993c5d1fab1133009,Central double cross-validation for estimating parameters in regression models,"The ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, forward stagewise regression and the least angle regression require a solution path and tuning parameter, Î», to estimate the coefficient vector. Therefore, it is crucial to find the ideal Î». Cross-validation (CV) is the most widely utilized method for choosing the ideal tuning parameter from the solution path. CV is essentially the breaking down of the original sample into two parts. One part is used to develop the regression equation. The regression equation is then applied to the other part to evaluate the risk of every model. Consequently, the final model is the model with smallest estimated risk. However, CV does not provide consistent results because it has overfitting and underfitting effects during the model selection. In the present study, a new method for estimating parameter in best-subset regression called central double cross-validation (CDCV) is proposed. In this method, the CV is run twice with different number of folds. Therefore, CDCV maximizes the usage of available data, enhances the model selection performance and builds a new stable CV curve. The final model with an error of less than ?? standard error above the smallest CV error is chosen. The CDCV was compared to existing CV methods in determining the correct model via a simulation study with different sample size and correlation settings. Simulation study indicates that the proposed CDCV method has the highest percentage of obtaining the right model and the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value across multiple simulated study settings. The results showed that, CDCV has the ability to select the right model correctly and prevent the model from underfitting and overfitting. Therefore, CDCV is recommended as a good alternative to the existing methods in the simulation settings.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rou Shi Chye"", ids = ""1396583561"")",,,,,

54865db2e2e39f684b355abd0745ca05575b59f4,Degrees of Freedom for Piecewise Lipschitz Estimators,"A representation of the degrees of freedom akin to Stein's lemma is given for a class of estimators of a mean value parameter in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Contrary to previous results our representation holds for a range of discontinues estimators. It shows that even though the discontinuities form a Lebesgue null set, they cannot be ignored when computing degrees of freedom. Estimators with discontinuities arise naturally in regression if data driven variable selection is used. Two such examples, namely best subset selection and lasso-OLS, are considered in detail in this paper. For lasso-OLS the general representation leads to an estimate of the degrees of freedom based on the lasso solution path, which in turn can be used for estimating the risk of lasso-OLS. A similar estimate is proposed for best subset selection. The usefulness of the risk estimates for selecting the number of variables is demonstrated via simulations with a particular focus on lasso-OLS.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Frederik Riis Mikkelsen"", ids = ""36229529""); list(name = ""Niels Richard Hansen"", ids = ""143778151"")",28a48c5291236e69e513d2e9358d4a6d489c6a28; c6eb7b05aa6b7f5be79a2820d6ff6e4aea0be3a2,8cc9918add61ee5ef3b848aba9646169cc5e364e; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 61f53054eecddcca3f78915e70c62aa80af1ec8f; daab979a418f96409774b3a7241cff2cac4d1be2; 68b38f057e593f02fa4c64c4cbf481d34c09cb7b; 553228f7842bda7be48c46e2d53f128d025dd1c5; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; 1e94dbacf2fedaeaab614dfad3b1b40ebb7f4537; d97d7f1109206fe6925badd934b4c8dc9a3b380d; dcbfed708df1ea92ce3b01fc12e3f01e6ecdbb10; 3da3a6ad646426582758459a4bcd0955a22daaae; e6676264d3af3604ee25f931aae78448b924fcf2; f5d74edd1b4023930145d756c73ae4e48165c930; d724f56299a11ad6e13570bf65b1baed9a34f0bf; 11473d353c7efd41559f8fda8cbe4f194ac9dc50; cbaf5ea0b865bcbecd0d3ce59866332051a01422; dc423c0563ac6c80ae8af840c8560438644a0e59; c19ee9b45151c1a6eb1cea566ba5cc10cab3c5a2; 132daa9be756ce5ac7caa4d43847f63bc36d2124; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 123261892642e377cf133a607b3199e60c7d4a41; 1b654bc405383f3dc2fe3ef74d267eebd3d0f8f4; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e9a0d2ba7a11dd1468af8152aa91e3832f7c3850; f1f6a2a84649fb037f0c02c335052a77ef48605e,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,819-841
0f8aa1b7d999f6478a6d3195275222636f3483c8,Regularized Structural Equation Modeling.,"A new method is proposed that extends the use of regularization in both lasso and ridge regression to structural equation models. The method is termed regularized structural equation modeling (RegSEM). RegSEM penalizes specific parameters in structural equation models, with the goal of creating easier to understand and simpler models. Although regularization has gained wide adoption in regression, very little has transferred to models with latent variables. By adding penalties to specific parameters in a structural equation model, researchers have a high level of flexibility in reducing model complexity, overcoming poor fitting models, and the creation of models that are more likely to generalize to new samples. The proposed method was evaluated through a simulation study, two illustrative examples involving a measurement model, and one empirical example involving the structural part of the model to demonstrate RegSEM's utility.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ross Jacobucci"", ids = ""8490482""); list(name = ""Kevin J Grimm"", ids = ""5163661""); list(name = ""J J Mcardle"", ids = ""143705836"")",ffc8d98020e96ea586b8039386dad263fa856e1e; 3b72e72c2aea119e0407e89dd5d4a832bdd628f5; b77f0ceaa3809a96c16cd0ef3c44ab8f2c544323; ae2fe1de9c70afcf114f45bed9b4d7061c8088c1; 4933e1400f5c823932c3ee10d8453cc04c94d6e5; cd5207b4181fb4f0664ccde3169270d11578ffbd; 900d6c7b978664736d3d9568d7d6dc51f7db13d1; 232951e620dd8637e46af298fbf906223f443d8b; 3140ab017a7efe582bb8c87919c2cd1cec62eb50; 8d5771cd61b66b4e0749b4e58c0c1eeff6226082; 756ecfd6ae11fdd082fa667988a66881e1d4271a; 6ce29aed9ec1b5925cfa7a72ab0b19a01ab5dc11; 3d94a4c817e3a823daa9b19a9a4babcbb332dfdd; d5fdc1bccb0ee87b57aeb57fb8f88ee4ae158ab2; 266ece7382544cfda5c361213a7010298368733b; bc063a5b9e7da562f61498f082147a2c3a3de8b7; f9cf0a5b68623d1de456c20e849db9278e0b7bcc; 7faf6708f5b67a90b0e08b6a25fae9c1fd1255ac; dd134811307e320eece75d3ad3f09a0a6e0cf0b3; 37373de4f521ea82b3bc455564f8119c039e6a54; fefc6557ef19fed43c77c7e89a5e2602f399cb8e; 0111c0b20044abeddd853e80aaa82b47154737f9; 8ff1df583f65662fe0acaf8bb695ae1fba1ca2f9; 946567ae1a6c5f61f115a4309da2e0fe03e6f327; 03a6e3545610c14131a3167a46a17f29710a6e11; c9fc15037593ccd79762c7fd4575ebd3851ce627; d1e28cd04f7e9d12a13c9ede6b44a51ea9652f4b,3617864e6f32967213ac978302ca670ad8e157b9; 0025fc4f00c21960297fbdf83220d6bde75da645; 7b6531a3f6b4dabd9351c7b287941774f3c3fd8a,Structural equation modeling : a multidisciplinary journal,23 4,"

55d59edd0ab7338da491a1f2c9b9681cfd75535a,Stromal Gene Expression is Predictive for Metastatic Primary Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Clinical grading systems using clinical features alongside nomograms lack precision in guiding treatment decisions in prostate cancer (PCa). There is a critical need for identification of biomarkers that can more accurately stratify patients with primary PCa.


OBJECTIVE
To identify a robust prognostic signature to better distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
To develop the signature, whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing was conducted on five PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models collected from independent foci of a single primary tumor and exhibiting variable metastatic phenotypes. Multiple independent clinical cohorts including an intermediate-risk cohort were used to validate the biomarkers.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The outcome measurement defining aggressive PCa was metastasis following radical prostatectomy. A generalized linear model with lasso regularization was used to build a 93-gene stroma-derived metastasis signature (SDMS). The SDMS association with metastasis was assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to compare the SDMS alongside clinicopathological variables and reported signatures. AUC was assessed to determine if SDMS is additive or synergistic to previously reported signatures.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
A close association between stromal gene expression and metastatic phenotype was observed. Accordingly, the SDMS was modeled and validated in multiple independent clinical cohorts. Patients with higher SDMS scores were found to have worse prognosis. Furthermore, SDMS was an independent prognostic factor, can stratify risk in intermediate-risk PCa, and can improve the performance of other previously reported signatures.


CONCLUSIONS
Profiling of stromal gene expression led to development of an SDMS that was validated as independently prognostic for the metastatic potential of prostate tumors.


PATIENT SUMMARY
Our stroma-derived metastasis signature can predict the metastatic potential of early stage disease and will strengthen decisions regarding selection of active surveillance versus surgery and/or radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, profiling of stroma cells should be more consistent than profiling of diverse cellular populations of heterogeneous tumors.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fan Mo"", ids = ""46502436""); list(name = ""Dong Lin"", ids = ""98577519""); list(name = ""Mandeep M Takhar"", ids = ""14816282""); list(name = ""Varune R.

1bbe81805cdb9b09535b5b944e09e632ed070801,What explains health in persons with visual impairment?,"BackgroundVisual impairment is associated with important limitations in functioning. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) relies on a globally accepted framework for classifying problems in functioning and the influence of contextual factors. Its comprehensive perspective, including biological, individual and social aspects of health, enables the ICF to describe the whole health experience of persons with visual impairment. The objectives of this study are (1) to analyze whether the ICF can be used to comprehensively describe the problems in functioning of persons with visual impairment and the environmental factors that influence their lives and (2) to select the ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health of persons with visual impairment.MethodsData from 105 persons with visual impairment were collected, including socio-demographic data, vision-related data, the Extended ICF Checklist and the visual analogue scale of the EuroQoL-5D, to assess self-perceived health. Descriptive statistics and a Group Lasso regression were performed. The main outcome measures were functioning defined as impairments in Body functions and Body structures, limitations in Activities and restrictions in Participation, influencing Environmental factors and self-perceived health.ResultsIn total, 120 ICF categories covering a broad range of Body functions, Body structures, aspects of Activities and Participation and Environmental factors were identified. Thirteen ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health were selected based on the Group Lasso regression. While Activities-and-Participation categories were selected most frequently, the greatest impact on self-perceived health was found in Body-functions categories. The ICF can be used as a framework to comprehensively describe the problems of persons with visual impairment and the Environmental factors which influence their lives.ConclusionsThere are plenty of ICF categories, Environmental-factors categories in particular, which are relevant to persons with visual impairment, but have hardly ever been taken into consideration in literature and visual impairment-specific patient-reported outcome measures.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juliane Leissner"", ids = ""152670373""); list(name = ""Michaela Coenen"", ids = ""4111444""); list(name = ""Stephan Froehlich"", ids = ""40391495""); list(name = ""Danny Loyola"", ids = ""39843515""); list(name = ""Alarcos Cieza"", ids = ""3206083"")",895b82e2363ac2f220055305c937567e798348c6; d1f43aba4d400124ac08a909d7ba352f91067774; 03b6e0e672b702b7a2ac57813ace7a8ac67638d0; 0ff9d49fd9c03b4974a01ca1f0f13d750cda13b2; d71a35edb18f26abcda22c758e248259d7c65115; cae17e4dcdd67343b0eb48c4e1d32b11ee7897a7; 1bbe81805cdb9b09535b5b944e09e632ed070801; 879d60cf8da457a1f2f693dfe709d6e3cf871187; 6a81b2a2a16d1f1657c0a287efecdd31031dbf1b; e7496214e5b7f7a5ade93bd15fe2f97147e0b022; f73fca3a80099dc649c81d9a59c995c315eaab6a; dee609d68cfc10a3fd993017ce491f8332419077; 23112a895744dd76e5953b606efa256b0a9386cb; 3c4b95f195e06ff40a16ff0802e5ee0ae88ee100,6a8f0b658160809df02f91493566c78408a66863; d1e3a9af845897ec5f283cfdccbdb896ff40759f; 0b0975634854130f2a20d079e20d258acecebb75; 06cb0076e310136d0ca8b56cc8585ec2bf43e029; 2f9f0444677a348ea3def780c771b42a0a0add18; 1a3f20e3ddb38bf7587fb69b1ccded6b75b26295; 8a81a11eedef820ecd3d4a497b74bfb2f0d98dd6; b8181b505b3d043ef8db7fbbe810592e7f9b36eb; 037bc380d707213e1800884524fff5fd9438b2a4; 5d51142dda5bd8ec586e58e9e56b84e9d151f501; 876e23e43630aa98ae6c84fbabcf57c5776fd382; aab45dcb4f4fbf4caa50514090e88a3eda353f10; e187dc820acb41746fc79e50d437245b7e7ec92e; 476d78f3b262d7d0401664a2f63895d23303fbf7; be6f3f8df0ccd07115cc83fcdc8e0f37c2da59b0; c9f9f77d44591141469fc3cb173cd69134faf058; 5303c61666db6d5822f9be698b53e138f8a88ffe; f2a220f50de28ba639f3ad50e40d99954c3276c6; cf7f7d0f1325271bdad461d136167b26f6b10ae7; 3f0f08e35eb8e82443a180799970d42e690af473; caf70deb49c378dd109609123850327e71b61988; 62522dc7a2fb2d43e4740a1ec7971a2ee0c42d20; 7642e410024e3457400485f90e65dfc785e7dc1c; 34539f6bc894999ce7ed2f83d08c734cb634faa9; ac6e65a580aa00d3ffe12fd9ab35786669f546e3; 253c2ac3236f24a49beb9f78cd28fc3317ae20aa; 73f8dad8f5ef86d5c42694028c710678f92b0ac2; 1fc6a8b1efbb0e8a21c405d6d98ccc28e5126055; 853f291005476255371864353c1c4688924bbc64; 38e5a784410c756a480979755c0493de296fccd6; ae9c7ea578ee1cac8f0385e97f91876035aff94c; 9703425709a47a87ab1c878fd745b6d13030eb95; aca6659b9d5b059785a049f2749fcd70fc4b2c2e; a71704679ab9b47c37e6b238396c89ccf7ed305c; 0db365fc98b3be350bf5c4f0115b737364e578b4; 067a896d58ee9a8b7b6e7091b0c7e974001fd380; 1bbe81805cdb9b09535b5b944e09e632ed070801; 9b59aee8b27745234fceb3c63201496853d5233d; e8b618bb8ca70a9cc2efa9be6600c480b8aa3ab2; 08667ac0d7689718bf4c3a3fff8710c27d21a2a7; 7e7814ac63a48dc08824bd55bcaa4206bf855659; 7c596778a68a0a04b30127738ee19ea6c47ac8d9; ebf724545296f5966f8b4bdcdbc57e66c6e951da; 19a111edb29e008f6d20e5b2f9b6d4e63264be3a; a790ddca19a54e917425731b159bcc1c0681e9c9; 8227ca9ec75ea49545ad78931ac1c19ee4359873; 37a220c87c88e7ec1124d14ec39edbe0009ebc81; b2da27a05c7153f85adeec36f16371ea96367ec8; ecfe2f2fc87e5e26fe0f41ca74e78441c3f547cf; 71d89792b7518861708e39c753345bab5ef92fbd; 6a75358d19a5959db13aa2bbfa9416a3bd888e94; 6861aaffd03bb18704cb76edadfc7529f19fb297; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 8576f128319b533326fb6588a3fd11ad992ebaab; e34bf03eb9ec1bc8bb3a7554b1fde61c8656d945; 7733880622dc2bf46ebb157bc30421a62b3e2b13; 8f4049c29f311d647f2461176e2aadd3baed092e; bef19e14480fde712656125948029b8dda2cc0be; c560e6fd122a1ecf4a0bcbaee50412c3dfe9da60; 34d8cd170b45d8aacdff7a7fe2e9583f84795fb5; 3e296965bd66f7db147db858330b7962f77fe266; 6dbc6204fbe6167d665b854f990e2a3bba1cdea4; 23fda581408ec1a3b905a4bcc764e9f3eff3129e; 3f72c21666c4ff5fd16a5f7607883d355873fe92; a22558314a237e2e73dbae80779d8f990ae78973,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,12,65 - 65
7c29b99f96a013c8d11a0d79c94a3f0f7dc889e8,Lazy lasso for local regression,"Locally weighted regression is a technique that predicts the response for new data items from their neighbors in the training data set, where closer data items are assigned higher weights in the prediction. However, the original method may suffer from overfitting and fail to select the relevant variables. In this paper we propose combining a regularization approach with locally weighted regression to achieve sparse models. Specifically, the lasso is a shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. We present an algorithm that embeds lasso in an iterative procedure that alternatively computes weights and performs lasso-wise regression. The algorithm is tested on three synthetic scenarios and two real data sets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms linear and local models for several kinds of scenarios.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Diego Vidaurre"", ids = ""1747030""); list(name = ""Concha Bielza"", ids = ""1687365""); list(name = ""Pedro LarraÃ±aga"", ids = ""144999310"")",c1e1a7bb32f19e66f82d87f9c8bc4c433b4c98d0; 0333b6208ed64b25f43c1622bf61bbdfd5b6df74; 36ec9856a42a30dd44bd9002677ca517a45fc481; 716231ad7463d8c2d6052628e5a13283043b2c74; 6abcc36512f15e6024782abf877d58a1ee460aaa; 2f91fada0f42cecddff8c9a929cfd351c66d45f8; 11f942cfddfc5184eda2a3fdde64d1e3a94e23cc; 8301dcc0d7fa1212e22974229aa46043e3157177; 021c26570e44f00e32513a9265d26c821a6ea604,1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 36ab8bd64210ac5c4f7d326ed2c0a5745e91320f; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 3546012c63dd1839430e1197987a6198bcbce33f; ababe42d14d08e1c92b795f0e22cf492c75cc16b; 99992e5362f2b83b35cf0c3d9c6af924d25e0afe; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 37ba888d41bf607d7169a8f05a90e9afb28c3a07; 28cd57afa9089d1cc5274f97434cde8565e01524; 9adfe05db0ed9b27e61913443b4879d3aca213d8; ef9c7086ac54581ad5f40f71bddba378cbd82603; eb8812e04a844078ff1e76ed93655295d588dd22; 24af058c97fc2ca9821a8cd08266545a010c1d09; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; d68e4a8cc150d888c5290180e433af527090bd84; 30e7e25061b7ccd9a625548dd6836afcff85043b; b81e61b920b986ff1495af426aad7437c9011d85; 035256a8a6d8a73af2adb38245f4130daa1f0535; 3bab279a1d788fd740bb5b757b2e50dd8261d5db; c50342756c4f303bfacc89c48223a6f1b64a7029; 3762b521d871d0adf90a35e0411ce861a4d14859; dab8c701d1f1c9134a5994515c07c919e8eb9db6; 401f51da617cb5bba2cde72f0afc2337cd9dc5aa; f603e9476b6613e4f36c5848902a17b3af19e1cb; e87f9b613d1012126a2b3fc62bc861e8054dd628; bdb6d7e0396a559d34b7582220d4e4a590e98ff1; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6; c08cae9bd11e903e301e1f69ef28eb3cba663fb2; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; 6e5078293a77d8e45503606eefd43ebe1226251a; 97387111430f3fd54d659c172a8c7b8036d78dff; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; c68297283a0b5212f9d4f9b277d709906fc57b98; ed67af3973dfc2394ea7fdb5a806e9b242840fc5; c02d91870513ac86da27a43df8a03b0c9d4bc511; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; c42e04432577eed0e90927ca64eaa6e92ee0262b,Computational Statistics,27,531-550

Although the PLS (partial least squares) regression combined with the VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores is often used when the multicollinearity is present among variables, there are few guidelines about its uses as well as its performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factorsâ€“the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Il-Gyo Chong"", ids = ""2040651""); list(name = ""Chi-Hyuck Jun"", ids = ""1823126"")",10e6165575db5e61a2ae77d469e817ca80e32975;

3b77d15308fa0d34d520edfec2b99bd8376eb27e,What is the US Comparative Advantage in Entrepreneurship? Evidence from Israeli Migration to the United States,"This paper investigates the underlying sources of the US entrepreneurial ecosystem's comparative advantage by assessing the benefits Israeli technology startups derive from migrating to the US. To address positive sorting into migration we adopt three complementary approaches, which include examining exogenous institutional constraints on the startups' ability to migrate, estimating a double-LASSO regression, and estimating a startup fixed-effects model exploiting across migrant variation in migration age. We show that migrants raise larger funding amounts and are more likely both to apply for a trademark and to be acquired than non-migrants. Conditional on an acquisition, migrants also achieve a higher transaction value. However, they do not hold more patents than non-migrants. We conclude that the US entrepreneurial ecosystemâ€™s comparative advantage vis-a-vis other innovative economies, such as Israel, arises from a multitude of sources that produce sizeable gains for startups. These sources are high investor availability, a large consumer market, and a developed market for acquisitions.",2019,Business,"list(name = ""Annamaria Conti"", ids = ""34785034""); list(name = ""Jorge GuzmÃ¡n"", ids = ""122045555"")",,,,,

7be7efa8b6c40304873f01d0470f04a0d19f73dd,Estimating Influenza Outbreaks Using Both Search Engine Query Data and Social Media Data in South Korea,"BACKGROUND
As suggested as early as in 2006, logs of queries submitted to search engines seeking information could be a source for detection of emerging influenza epidemics if changes in the volume of search queries are monitored (infodemiology). However, selecting queries that are most likely to be associated with influenza epidemics is a particular challenge when it comes to generating better predictions.


OBJECTIVE
In this study, we describe a methodological extension for detecting influenza outbreaks using search query data; we provide a new approach for query selection through the exploration of contextual information gleaned from social media data. Additionally, we evaluate whether it is possible to use these queries for monitoring and predicting influenza epidemics in South Korea.


METHODS
Our study was based on freely available weekly influenza incidence data and query data originating from the search engine on the Korean website Daum between April 3, 2011 and April 5, 2014. To select queries related to influenza epidemics, several approaches were applied: (1) exploring influenza-related words in social media data, (2) identifying the chief concerns related to influenza, and (3) using Web query recommendations. Optimal feature selection by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and support vector machine for regression (SVR) were used to construct a model predicting influenza epidemics.


RESULTS
In total, 146 queries related to influenza were generated through our initial query selection approach. A considerable proportion of optimal features for final models were derived from queries with reference to the social media data. The SVR model performed well: the prediction values were highly correlated with the recent observed influenza-like illness (r=.956; P<.001) and virological incidence rate (r=.963; P<.001).


CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate the feasibility of using search queries to enhance influenza surveillance in South Korea. In addition, an approach for query selection using social media data seems ideal for supporting influenza surveillance based on search query data.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyekyung Woo"", ids = ""6667800""); list(name = ""Youngtae Cho"", ids = ""48747129""); list(name = ""Eunyoung Shim"", ids = ""34300801""); list(name = ""Jong-Koo Lee"", ids = ""48174451""); list(name = ""Chang-Gun Lee"", ids = ""1722690""); list(name = ""Seong Hwan Kim"", ids = ""4381383"")",2e28fd794d5b4a036221f2b166f501de4f904c31; 38fac3626e162bdbad353eb70212486b2ac0288b; e6570bb05b9aed9d042d4ef58e3fb8843c4d618e; 539ebc16737a7d43b43c582f3b625050c2bff9a8; cb511b51caab78ee11d7e3b1068af1b7fbcb911d; f2092b8b9424fee03321bfb8f1175563caad065c; 4ade9fb8ea22a3cc6328dd972c7401c4cefc0a0c; e1c11d63fc867f97b8cb0e2b8d96616064355e80; 33f5d8fff76f2d3cabc9ceda752e933c58d45105; 663c7d66e4faab855b34f4e188473fcbe0151860; 30bee315d9e11bf4bbcc06914cc472033bc522f0; 7b732caf4bcda266962799c43e2b6c5f2026b72f; 1a085588357a2ff34e7f712cd2cc8c37d77952c0; fe788f78b002532a19bff1d266d362e4dcd38923; 43703e2567e93aaea249b0b610b7fb046b02950d; 823ffece67f0edd0710eca0ff16c4d1c918d45e2; da8d2256b577b748b18a454660ab95005f6bda6a; f54c2d4b6dbf5985a4da1c0b7ad08370dfe6f7dd; d1674a0851414df3b973a55326fd4bb60c29810a; 7b5266177c907df96f1f47f4986956dd213000de; f2c5a645414c3b644e9a7e53389a03752fff3b44; 5dad8966a092878b1a787d45b9f2a499b4b76112; 0e46ed7b9e58bcc5e4b860da71955fdb73c99e7c; c74a6a59acc564053832e4262fd4da5b4015e7d9; 3293482a62655add20e309d096919d336b43a99a,bf01d5a8fccc70eab539b6c2930101910aec82c4; 00d681cfff7f0224ace607e515f4ed510e792df9; 6aa757d2c16fec63e394de2506e88dfa58cf5896; d8384f7ef288d2d5cb267128471c5427fc98b54b; f8ecf6e3de44ac703537f0a89956197b733c7214; 34d405eaecab40a932108a7ff97e92fb8fd1ae4e; 2ff33eb0020550b93a6fc474ff2ff1b673ba00f7; a84886440a3e396c959d61cf088f6247522aa30c; 60b249993cc7245969c6ed16bd0c233593c88cfe; 74007d5a0dcfc70e0dbd281081f1408fed1a9116; 1d68580c9b4829cfadbe72c335a2b9c12c17abc2; 377337bdd2be31bdcbbbd2faf366fc9eb194aa9b; 42e8308872f46fcb048577dc194bec7719e2ae72; d9fa529a15fbf0df1f0ca94f5aa15ab54d9d9d2e; 4b41b4e698c1dec42de342393145fda3b7049d8f; 2b5081abd1c0a606f63c58bfcf47bea6d2075ac5; 93c234e23590854055cc33cc1d96a24fb35b6466; e76d0395bbb49d9a78a52bc9cd9c8a3676ce5d72; 06bb5771e6b8a9356c5f4ae28c98b4397c043349; c7d67ef2d8f4bbd1caf8774bdf2676b487c9e433,Journal of Medical Internet Research,18,
5d254ea2f857156ef5e15d4deb8fa139707f3452,Integrated analysis of DNA-methylation and gene expression using high-dimensional penalized regression: a cohort study on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women,"BackgroundUsing high-dimensional penalized regression we studied genome-wide DNA-methylation in bone biopsies of 80 postmenopausal women in relation to their bone mineral density (BMD). The women showed BMD varying from severely osteoporotic to normal. Global gene expression data from the same individuals was available, and since DNA-methylation often affects gene expression, the overall aim of this paper was to include both of these omics data sets into an integrated analysis.MethodsThe classical penalized regression uses one penalty, but we incorporated individual penalties for each of the DNA-methylation sites. These individual penalties were guided by the strength of association between DNA-methylations and gene transcript levels. DNA-methylations that were highly associated to one or more transcripts got lower penalties and were therefore favored compared to DNA-methylations showing less association to expression. Because of the complex pathways and interactions among genes, we investigated both the association between DNA-methylations and their corresponding cis gene, as well as the association between DNA-methylations and trans-located genes. Two integrating penalized methods were used: first, an adaptive group-regularized ridge regression, and secondly, variable selection was performed through a modified version of the weighted lasso.ResultsWhen information from gene expressions was integrated, predictive performance was considerably improved, in terms of predictive mean square error, compared to classical penalized regression without data integration. We found a 14.7% improvement in the ridge regression case and a 17% improvement for the lasso case. Our version of the weighted lasso with data integration found a list of 22 interesting methylation sites. Several corresponded to genes that are known to be important in bone formation. Using BMD as response and these 22 methylation sites as covariates, least square regression analyses resulted in R2=0.726, comparable to an average R2=0.438 for 10000 randomly selected groups of DNA-methylations with group size 22.ConclusionsTwo recent types of penalized regression methods were adapted to integrate DNA-methylation and their association to gene expression in the analysis of bone mineral density.

8efdaba071aa68968ff6f214cfded94da56063d2,Machine Learning Prediction of Mortality and Hospitalization in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"OBJECTIVES
This study sought to develop models for predicting mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization for outpatients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial.


BACKGROUND
Although risk assessment models are available for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, few have assessed the risks of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF.


METHODS
The following 5 methods: logistic regression with a forward selection of variables; logistic regression with a lasso regularization for variable selection; random forest (RF); gradient descent boosting; and support vector machine, were used to train models for assessing risks of mortality and HF hospitalization through 3 years of follow-up and were validated using 5-fold cross-validation. Model discrimination and calibration were estimated using receiver-operating characteristic curves and Brier scores, respectively. The top prediction variables were assessed by using the best performing models, using the incremental improvement of each variable in 5-fold cross-validation.


RESULTS
The RF was the best performing model with a mean C-statistic of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.75) for predicting mortality (Brier score: 0.17), and 0.76 (95%Â CI: 0.71 to 0.81) for HF hospitalization (Brier score: 0.19). Blood urea nitrogen levels, body mass index, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) subscale scores were strongly associated with mortality, whereas hemoglobin level, blood urea nitrogen, time since previous HF hospitalization, and KCCQ scores were the most significant predictors of HF hospitalization.


CONCLUSIONS
These models predict the risks of mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with HFpEF and emphasize the importance of health status data in determining prognosis.

9c922dfe1987e3d81fe0398a74940aa386700c2a,Identification of an energy metabolism-related gene signature in ovarian cancer prognosis,"Changes in energy metabolism may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer as they frequently occur within cancer cells. However, basic cancer research has failed to reach a consistent conclusion on the function(s) of mitochondria in energy metabolism. The significance of energy metabolism in the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains unclear; thus, there remains an urgent need to systematically analyze the characteristics and clinical value of energy metabolism in ovarian cancer. Based on gene expression patterns, the present study aimed to analyze energy metabolismâ€‘associated characteristics to evaluate the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. A total of 39Â energy metabolismâ€‘related genes significantly associated with prognosis were obtained, and three molecular subtypes were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization clustering, among which the C1 subtype was associated with poor clinical outcomes of ovarian cancer. The immune response was enhanced in the tumor microenvironment. A total of 888Â differentially expressed genes were identified in C1 compared with the other subtypes, and the results of the pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that they were enriched in the 'PI3Kâ€‘Akt signaling pathway', 'cAMP signaling pathway', 'ECMâ€‘receptor interaction' and other pathways associated with the development and progression of tumors. Finally, eight characteristic genes (tolloidâ€‘like 1 gene, type XVI collagen, prostaglandin F2Î±, cartilage intermediate layer proteinÂ 2, kinesin family member 26b, interferon inducible proteinÂ 27, growth arrestâ€‘specific geneÂ 1 and chemokine receptorÂ 7) were obtained through LASSO feature selection; and a number of them have been demonstrated to be associated with ovarian cancer progression. In addition, Cox regression analysis was performed to establish an 8â€‘gene signature, which was determined to be an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer and could stratify sample risk in the training, test and external validation datasets (P<0.01; AUCÂ >0.8). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results revealed that the 8â€‘gene signature was involved in important biological processes and pathways of ovarian cancer. In conclusion, the present study established an 8â€‘gene signature associated with metabolic genes, which may provide new insights into the effects of energy metabolism on ovarian cancer. The 8â€‘gene signature may serve as an independent prognostic factor for ovarian cancer patients.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Li-fang Wang"", ids = ""49681071""); list(name = ""Xiuqin Li"", ids = ""47058286"")",,e6608fd66682e12483975a7f948b3ea45b6af9dc; ac2f57d51076c161d14e24b7611f59f67bdc5e1d; a32b9768cf1872270d275d20b6c775a0cb4f3fc6; 37fc6dd11a34f6c693b223e4930dbdc27fb04736; e35bd4b47b48c663393bbdfaa46b41452d51cd87; 1659fe68c7dc9f9c70efd2438a7d812681ec1a7a; b5f0c9bfd94b3e5c378f59c31d7b30c94ec99f58; 05848a1421a8785ee7d4a95697fa38b94c3f5878; 89a8a0729869407f8bfbebe8e7529af3e6ef9c9b; 5ef8284be6094d4b60571fcddbce76d3b7292623; da5a2b69d52b25525e043f61744305dfcb2a0e61; fc5056d6ee1032ca7be695c6865340a6d952d22e; f4945bb5a78c902d111828410ea15995f9d460eb; 5e8e6970cdcf1ff4b116ece647c22d154d83e6fb; 69adb4baba0138a9db50d97f1fdd08c086adf0ff; baa5432638d7e3fd8fec14fb5c9e6441a927d0d6; 5af5d4bf4675a35a1f01bb4401867699a6276d45; 8e5e888233903790ab34f39aec9bf64524382c56; c31ef2a4867c4fc1be6b70f3b4d2e8948f5b4a27; 870a34459ce2211e02026849ade5a63daaa2bced; 7edacd9a256ceb8d558475d6c780c434dad62fe4; 15cc2989593c9556ff9c63fd2acd0fff0744dcec; f80a6ab4b0cfae0d00747f0f41f3e643f22f33ee; e060163e1a717be29c52dd35e1b839c85870c6c0; f9245407d1306e5743cc5cd7329bce629c9a7276; cb30598b3f6d793cb3ab4878f13e8e1bec0936c3; 81e033ac2a9232e1ed58ef3d7a15c16c137de102; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; c012b2ec5b76a7680cdbec24cba2914ce8b66a84; 7a95922170ee39e3b1540ed0548b62c5af1313cb; 78ecfc0170ac916311ea5fcd55923a2bf6232b7e; bd1d86156f6a950ac155e6bf37f0b88d0e9ebb1f; 82a7ad52d7745fccf99668e564ca143756e048df; 101a663a2c5c42a5eca7fbb8589e0922e37040f7; 1f55e12da8df9fe31e3d3f39a3772d35c507c925; fd116de74f5c3789a3423e07b99a13be481b8dd1; c55a13bf584ba0cc1233b1fae2f106d0920c55bb; 8af60cdd8624aeff7e91688d26adc6577353ec5f; ca56d81a955d804397c6f36553ee572da7f6c731; 9c4e6570d39a8ca83b87c2283909fce2c9745ba0; 45352a209bd5d05829bbe867351b2665000743a5; 758af97162fed871e20cc8f36bab544a5e0cc997; 6e02a2ce13d5b55efbbe589eb06ffe7e0960072b; b948e5ad275c951b32f53bed8bf6bde0826c78e6; d06f73e80428db812f885c3c1ff150cbd8ad7b37; 932c0da846cf00eb1295fec38f908621e4a8a5b5; 71010ab09ca566a4d022f03056ac986f77d0b368; 6bffd532a8b3fa39be5056cf33819348209a2faf; 0e423d26b195eb3ac49890201016c2366e949580; 5e52a0dd8885ca38af10699863b0a92d4acf0e12; 293da445ce23d1c9b92640ce28e3defd7ffe1fc6; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; d8bd861b292233072aa40ab6bc029ac94d7f30af; 516549f159c0bfc65c0c605ea64c13ccab5c9456; 6ca0e6e3b39cd5131a29373f55d897128bce9d3b; acb83f061e8c9b82eed08e08003f35e5f82ef53d; b6e3ca2111fce9c5636cd4ba53a0a6263da4a9d9; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 3af045503abf81705fc1833aadf5db93a9be854c; 7047a70ec0492a56bbd01e7328df662bea9bd3db; e53b7247d9f29c9812937ad307924ebdddc885a3; f308a217889aad3fec5769d16721e68b3ea4d37f; 96d090af9c27beb8f1964fad3daa4d024f143f8b; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 151d16f1696f3c25258c0956f698881e21ed6efb; 57691c00a275c865b29e2614f24e8c1726d623a5; f61e1bb930e1e1321e33bcd4b5cdc97ab0e6412e; ba91cb0ddd55a66c0ee3322b79457e4771b851fc,Oncology Reports,43,1755 - 1770

42174c683d061ef99dd09d18d730906a45443eed,Development and validation of a panel of five proteins as blood biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer,"Objective
Reliable noninvasive biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly desirable for efficient population-based screening with high adherence rates. We aimed to discover and validate blood-based protein markers for the early detection of CRC.


Patients and methods
A two-stage design with a discovery and a validation set was used. In the discovery phase, plasma levels of 92 protein markers and serum levels of TP53 autoantibody were measured in 226 clinically recruited CRC patients and 118 controls who were free of colorectal neoplasms at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of CRC was derived by Lasso regression and validated in a validation set consisting of all available 41 patients with CRC and a representative sample of 106 participants with advanced adenomas and 107 controls free of neoplasm from a large screening colonoscopy cohort (N=6018). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers and biomarker combinations.


Results
An algorithm based on growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), amphiregulin (AREG), Fas antigen ligand (FasL), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and TP53 autoantibody was constructed. In the validation set, the areas under the curves of this five-marker algorithm were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.90) for detecting CRC and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.52-0.69) for detecting advanced adenomas. At cutoffs yielding 90% specificity, the sensitivities (95% CI) for detecting CRC and advanced adenomas were 56.4% (38.4%-71.8%) and 22.0% (13.4%-35.4%), respectively. The five-marker panel showed similar diagnostic efficacy for the detection of early- and late-stage CRC.

6dc71505c9c15c914f375da0b83956aeb7dedc2e,Machine learning approach to reconstructing signalling pathways and interaction networks in biology,"In this doctoral thesis, I present my research into applying machine learning techniques for reconstructing species interaction networks in ecology, reconstructing molecular signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks in systems biology, and inferring parameters in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of signalling pathways. Together, the methods I have developed for these applications demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning for reconstructing networks and inferring network parameters from data. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part is a detailed comparison of applying static Bayesian networks, relevance vector machines, and linear regression with L1 regularisation (LASSO) to the problem of reconstructing species interaction networks from species absence/presence data in ecology (Faisal et al., 2010). I describe how I generated data from a stochastic population model to test the different methods and how the simulation study led us to introduce spatial autocorrelation as an important covariate. I also show how we used the results of the simulation study to apply the methods to presence/absence data of bird species from the European Bird Atlas. The second part of the thesis describes a time-varying, non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian network model for reconstructing signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks, based on LÃ¨bre et al. (2010). I show how my work has extended this model to incorporate different types of hierarchical Bayesian information sharing priors and different coupling strategies among nodes in the network. The introduction of these priors reduces the inference uncertainty by putting a penalty on the number of structure changes among network segments separated by inferred changepoints (Dondelinger et al., 2010; Husmeier et al., 2010; Dondelinger et al., 2012b). Using both synthetic and real data, I demonstrate that using information sharing priors leads to a better reconstruction accuracy of the underlying gene regulatory networks, and I compare the different priors and coupling strategies. I show the results of applying the model to gene expression datasets from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as to a synthetic biology gene expression dataset from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In each case, the underlying network is time-varying; for Drosophila melanogaster, as a consequence of measuring gene expression during different developmental stages; for Arabidopsis thaliana, as a consequence of measuring gene expression for circadian clock genes under different conditions; and for the synthetic biology dataset, as a consequence of changing the growth environment. I show that in addition to inferring sensible network structures, the model also successfully predicts the locations of iii changepoints. The third and final part of this thesis is concerned with parameter inference in ODE models of biological systems. This problem is of interest to systems biology researchers, as kinetic reaction parameters can often not be measured, or can only be estimated imprecisely from experimental data. Due to the cost of numerically solving the ODE system after each parameter adaptation, this is a computationally challenging problem. Gradient matching techniques circumvent this problem by directly fitting the derivatives of the ODE to the slope of an interpolant. I present an inference procedure for a model using nonparametric Bayesian statistics with Gaussian processes, based on Calderhead et al. (2008). I show that the new inference procedure improves on the original formulation in Calderhead et al. (2008) and I present the result of applying it to ODE models of predator-prey interactions, a circadian clock gene, a signal transduction pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway.

Epidemiologic studies suggest a strong link between poor habitual sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Metabolomic profiling may elucidate systemic differences associated with sleep quality that influence cardiometabolic health.


Methods
We explored cross-sectional associations between sleep quality and plasma metabolites in a nested case-control study of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; nâ€‰=â€‰1956) and attempted to replicate the results in an independent sample from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; nâ€‰=â€‰209). A sleep-quality score (SQS) was derived from self-reported sleep problems asked in both populations. Plasma metabolomics were assayed using LC-MS with 347 known metabolites. General linear regression was used to identify individual metabolites associated with continuous SQS (false-discovery rate <0.05). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, a metabolite score was created from replicated metabolites and evaluated with CHD risk in the WHI.


Results
After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and smoking, we identified 69 metabolites associated with SQS in the WHI (59 were lipids). Of these, 16 were replicated in NHSII (15 were lipids), including 6 triglycerides (TAGs), 4 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 1 diglyceride (DAG), 1 lysophosphatidylcholine and N6-acetyl-L-lysine (a product of histone acetylation). These metabolites were consistently higher among women with poorer sleep quality. The LASSO selection resulted in a nine-metabolite score (TAGs 45: 1, 48: 1, 50: 4; DAG 32: 1; PEs 36: 4, 38: 5; PCs 30: 1, 40: 6; N6-acetyl-L-lysine), which was positively associated with CHD risk (odds ratio per SD increase in the score: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.28; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003) in the WHI after adjustment for matching factors and conventional CHD risk factors.

0810ae38ccdb394eb1e683fe7c7742c8cd9fa9aa,A radiomics approach to predict lymph node metastasis and clinical outcome of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,"ObjectivesThis study was conducted in order to establish and validate a radiomics model for predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) and to determine its prognostic value.MethodsFor this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed in a primary cohort of 103 IHC patients who underwent curative-intent resection and lymphadenectomy. Radiomics features were extracted from arterial phase computed tomography (CT) scans. A radiomics signature was built based on highly reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adopted to establish a radiomics model incorporating radiomics signature and other independent predictors. Model performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was internally validated in 52 consecutive patients.ResultsThe radiomics signature comprised eight LN-statusâ€“related features and showed significant association with LN metastasis in both cohorts (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). A radiomics nomogram that incorporates radiomics signature and CA 19-9 level showed good calibration and discrimination in the primary cohort (AUC 0.8462) and validation cohort (AUC 0.8921). Promisingly, the radiomics nomogram yielded an AUC of 0.9224 in the CT-reported LN-negative subgroup. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of this nomogram. High risk for metastasis portended significantly lower overall and recurrence-free survival than low risk for metastasis (both pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The radiomics nomogram was an independent preoperative predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival.ConclusionsOur radiomics model provided a robust diagnostic tool for prediction of LN metastasis, especially in CT-reported LN-negative IHC patients, that may facilitate clinical decision-making.Key Pointsâ€¢ The radiomics nomogram showed good performance for prediction of LN metastasis in IHC patients, particularly in the CT-reported LN-negative subgroup.â€¢ Prognosis of high-risk patients remains dismal after curative-intent resection.â€¢ The radiomics model may facilitate clinical decision-making and define patient subsets benefiting most from surgery.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gu-Wei Ji"", ids = ""37624873""); list(name = ""Fei-peng Zhu"", ids = ""7526904""); list(name = ""Yu-Dong Zhang"", ids = ""46867408""); list(name = ""Xisheng Liu"", ids = ""1906592""); list(name = ""Fei-Yun Wu"", ids = ""50988164""); list(name = ""Ke Wang"", ids = ""50394804""); list(name = ""Yong-xiang Xia"", ids = ""2668523""); list(name = ""Yao-dong Zhang"", ids = ""49890054""); list(name = ""Wang-Jie Jiang"", ids = ""51160788""); list(name = ""Xiang-Cheng Li"", ids = ""7823223""); list(name = ""Xue-Hao Wang"", ids = ""12142604"")",4a6840a4bedc177f5ebfd237381d85b854ead3b2; a51f7836ea3675245b2beaa509633eea5afae702; 6af51ddaa843b537013a2c79aa841474a2817342; d10df8d7e4a5594053e970207272b903d1a270a7,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b839b889d7150315f06c9edcfd3040cbd33bc26a; e0c706402cf6cc205a0980ee047de9fc710c6aee; c53fa445bee435f567828db3a0ede0f08abdd0d5; 490a68ac4d3f778d958d19a72e97454a4f82e757; 75ec1c0907ebc0e87982d1736fd7bd31e27b9d92; 1d6fbb959a2d0f7d777748b804c3a432bcd6c98b; 4b244e4abe4320e35665f9cb6986f206b2f87586; e8c89eeae5be6ac82bdd8360160cec1142515d3e; 9f0737e979d9a8a2151ad0b48f812e5f1b728d43; 7ee801768a66e72f72b8ce2a408655d3e0a6334c; cd69b4cb74582a5a20963c7790fcd98a735528df; 5a8cbc412e86c62764e0fe5d2474144ad1bc6e59; bf5663c84832c552f320c08417d0cd6315b840a8; f2e3734e9dcff11a9d82cac2911d6af3f8c41418; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; 96187fedfa51e365e806b2ffb5d68966b68a12e3; a906af4905f68cec4d36a928fc72e18bfa0d510c; bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2; f9b5c08711b30103ffc7ba144d4f590bbd9b065b; 22156f304ad793812c7f0719251ad9c57f948003; d70ec5404ac426fe0da77dac316141e48da30c02; e567549edd60d204cc8ed66ef87834aa9510bc58; 8f6e439086b0471fa87c513521566b42be295501; 843092fd6193b2132ab57b817a35cd4f27c188a5; 7d885249039a6a88117ed2371f94c7cc2ab61eb8; 5c74bc70377131a46345067e03b31e642efb408b; 0e1ea7f9f0c3e1442ffbe2387be898df725fd899; 3908fc37bebf4281d4d7391a5aa0fda2a9e39d18; 1460d99a0d512ae50b74641598a34a97f39acceb; 731df2bb791c3fa221ca9498bfe43bb04b698357; a8e6a2b2912e97cf6b4dbf0e1df4f74e4bd93a26; ce7c921f8cd88920e53722dfe42b324341b4b4b6,European Radiology,29,3725-3735

The multivariate square-root Lasso is based on nuclear norm loss with l1-penalty. We show that this procedure leads to an asymptotically Ï‡2-distributed pivot, with a remainder term depending only on the l1-error of the initial estimator.

6662aeaebc847128821e2c18379208642ce2b4b4,Sliced Inverse Regression With Adaptive Spectral Sparsity for Dimension Reduction.,"Dimension reduction is an important topic in pattern analysis and machine learning, and it has wide applications in feature representation and pattern classification. In the past two decades, sliced inverse regression (SIR) has attracted much research efforts due to its effectiveness and efficacy in dimension reduction. However, two drawbacks limit further applications of SIR. First, the computation complexity of SIR is usually high in the situation of high-dimensional data. Second, sparsity of projection subspace is not well mined for improving the feature selection and model interpretation abilities. This paper proposes to compute the SIR projection vectors in the spectral space, then an approximated regression solution can be obtained with a faster speed. Moreover, the adaptive lasso is used to attain a sparse and globally optimal solution, which is important in variable selection. To complete the robust pattern classification task with corruptions, a correntropy-based and class-wise regression model is designed in this paper. It takes a smooth penalty instead of sparsity constraint in the regression coefficients, and it can be conducted in class-wise, thus it is more flexible in practice. Extensive experiments are conducted by using some real and benchmark data sets, e.g., high-dimensional facial images and gene microarray data, to evaluate the new algorithms. The new proposals attain competitive results and are compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiao-Lin Xu"", ids = ""1456356811""); list(name = ""Chuan-Xian Ren"", ids = ""1456328727""); list(name = ""Ran-Chao Wu"", ids = ""1456299077""); list(name = ""Hong Yan"", ids = ""146952468"")",8c969694ed448cd3390509da5da51c92718a1f09; 0e5793a858700ae65d31726a91bd6fd7959b45f9; 8c0d0f69872612d85199dbde6650b6e689a8edb4; d2e7efddde16ace00167601f004f6300a8adfa49; f61005d56fd1412a165cf931a3577dd06298a2a9; c9953af8b92bc66bd7824617f1b8447925025456,,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,47 3,"

86110fd0339ddc1d04aac54c7a835bedbba6f2b7,Identification of race-associated metabolite biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus infection,"Disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and survival have been observed between ethnic groups including African-Americans (AA) and European-Americans (EA). The evaluation of the changes in the levels of metabolites in samples stratified by race could provide a snapshot of ethnically diverse disease related pathways and identify reliable biomarkers. In this study, we considered AA and EA to investigate metabolites that may be associated with HCC in a race-specific manner. The levels of 46 metabolites in plasma samples, collected from patients recruited at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, were analyzed by Agilent GC-qMS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied to select metabolites with significant changes in HCC vs. cirrhosis in three groups: (1) AA and EA combined; (2) AA separately; and (3) EA separately. In addition, metabolites that distinguish HCC cases from cirrhosis in these three groups were selected by excluding those without HCV infection. The performances of the metabolites selected by LASSO in each group were evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation. We identified race-specific metabolites that differentiated HCC cases from cirrhotic controls, yielding better area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the serological marker widely used for the diagnosis of HCC. This study sheds light on metabolites that could potentially be used as biomarkers for HCC by monitoring their levels in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients in a race-specific manner.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cristina Di Poto"", ids = ""7427143""); list(name = ""Shisi He"", ids = ""38884530""); list(name = ""Rency S.

11d28af1ca14d4779f2163b9db538af610f5d226,"High-dimensional regression in practice: an empirical study of finite-sample prediction, variable selection and ranking","Penalized likelihood approaches are widely used for high-dimensional regression. Although many methods have been proposed and the associated theory is now well developed, the relative efficacy of different approaches in finite-sample settings, as encountered in practice, remains incompletely understood. There is therefore a need for empirical investigations in this area that can offer practical insight and guidance to users. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of penalized regression methods. We distinguish between three related goals: prediction, variable selection and variable ranking. Our results span more than 2300 data-generating scenarios, including both synthetic and semisynthetic data (real covariates and simulated responses), allowing us to systematically consider the influence of various factors (sample size, dimensionality, sparsity, signal strength and multicollinearity). We consider several widely used approaches (Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, SCAD, the Dantzig Selector and Stability Selection). We find considerable variation in performance between methods. Our results support a ""no panacea"" view, with no unambiguous winner across all scenarios or goals, even in this restricted setting where all data align well with the assumptions underlying the methods. The study allows us to make some recommendations as to which approaches may be most (or least) suitable given the goal and some data characteristics. Our empirical results complement existing theory and provide a resource to compare methods across a range of scenarios and metrics.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fan Wang"", ids = ""37408648""); list(name = ""Sach Mukherjee"", ids = ""145807368""); list(name = ""Sylvia Richardson"", ids = ""50130827""); list(name = ""Steven M Hill"", ids = ""50453012"")",,fa381d551ede545e511209ebb3e328de16c81e24; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; 45d770da4ac29b52de4f17446d43b45a2b61f3f8; 0113548122c1c6869eeafe6c2d21ee8a825c34c2; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; 6577213dab981883f03a083c9e495f1a707035da; dbbbecc7ba8460a9b215389e6ca0c09118b74e3b; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; d4ff7059aead6b8771f2259bed1c9232d95d28dc; 0bfd57b42c4620d3f51d0c75a3919eb9c7b73e83; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; dcdcb720c923c17e6602a7c5af6f308c235feb1b; 26ba69dcc38f3fbbd452477a1f08e2d67b5b49da; c9e55b6ecc6f65d2735830dede4f8d2bdf531d34; ca68550e865cdb68a335d3329d57653da646578d; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 1473110f6c33b483251ade10b79416d3efee2da4; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 2d5b040efec060b33c1c4ef72231655de93398c4; b84b8bd8daeaa786f1f5e2bb0b06313568198b34; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; af3508c05ccd3242172f40eddd1cdbc13fa000b2; e6db99fd95b7cd98f218bb44235aece8051cfcf0; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 20efb18888bb9142eaf7543946c2045203b4415a; 5f5bbfc164ffde5a124b738fd0de6f3c1e34a390,Statistics and Computing,30,697 - 719
8b4619ca10f25ad87a18b687ee2113fce58ee7a7,Nomogram for predicting overall survival in stage IIâ€III colorectal cancer,"PURPOSE
The overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed with stage II-III colorectal cancer (CRC) can vary greatly, even between patients with the same tumor stage. We aimed to design a nomogram to predict OS in resected, stage II-III CRC and stratify patients with CRC into different risk groups.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Based on data from 873 patients with CRC, we used univariate Cox regression analysis to select the significant prognostic features, which were subjected to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm for feature selection. Cross-validation was used to confirm suitable tuning parameters (Î») for LASSO logistic regression. Then, the nomogram was used to estimate 3- and 5-year OS based on the multivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves of the two groups were produced using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk group stratification was performed to assess the predictive capacity of the nomogram.


RESULTS
Preoperative mean platelet volume, preoperative platelet distribution width, monocytes, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were identified as independent prognostic factors by LASSO regression and integrated for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram provided good discrimination, with C-indices of 0.67 and 0.69 for the training and validation sets, respectively. Calibration plots illustrated excellent agreement between the nomogram predictions and actual observations for 3- and 5-year OS. Moreover, a significant difference in OS was shown between patients stratified into different risk groups (PÂ <Â .001).


CONCLUSION

fbe27421ca59a88c96221da5eb036c59acf4806e,Developing of predictive models for pneumonitis with forward variable selection and LASSO logistic model for breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT,"Abstract Purpose: To develop a multiple logistic regression model as normal tissue complication probability model by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique in breast cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), we focused on the changes of pulmonary function tests to achieve the optimal predictive parameters for the occurrence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (SRP). Materials and methods: Dosimetric and spirometry data of 60 breast cancer patients were analyzed. Pulmonary function tests were done before RT, after completion of RT, 3, and 6 months after RT. Multiple logistic regression model was used to obtain the effective predictive parameters. Forward selection method was applied in NTCP model to determine the effective risk factors from obtained different parameters. Results: Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was observed in five patients. Significant changes in pulmonary parameters have been observed at six months after RT. The parameters of mean lung dose (MLD), bridge separation (BS), mean irradiated lung volume (ILVmean), and the percentage of the ipsilateral lung volume that received dose of 20 Gy (IV20) introduced as risk factors using the LASSO technique for SRP in a multiple normal tissue complication probability model in breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT. The BS, central lung distance (CLD) and ILV in tangential field have obtained as 23.5 (20.9-26.0) cm, 2.4 (1.5-3.3) cm, and 12.4 (10.6-14.3) % of lung volume in radiation field in patients without pulmonary complication, respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that if BS, CLD, and ILV are more than 23 cm, 2 cm, and 12%, respectively, so incidence of SRP in the patients will be considerable. Our multiple NTCP LASSO model for breast cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT showed that in order to have minimum probability of SRP occurrence, parameters of BS, IV20, ILV and especially MLD would be kept in minimum levels. Considering dose-volume histogram, the mean lung dose factor is most important parameter which minimizing it in treatment planning, minimizes the probability of SRP and consequently improves the quality of life in breast cancer patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maede Hasan Abdali"", ids = ""66104027""); list(name = ""Karim Khoshgard"", ids = ""14218496""); list(name = ""Abdolazim Sedighi Pashaki"", ids = ""15980679"")",,b45b4e00bfa062e1f68202de106cc1a2e8f50bd2; 2451c3f75bd0eb9000d1b190c3d72dadda704337; 6b01b2a333fdf0b77735c60140226ef2abcd45de; ced39ab47e52c9c6752488b64c4abeb1c768f3e4; ca4e573f523e7f2637370ea03b6bc668512211df; 686b5d8deecea5f6485fde9b31ee9cdba9a13cb0; 446d06de60be91f5f384f5e9290654438b83abc1; 6148bbfd2c797e8dad02633c9c05326b804397a7; 19a90acb0e49d16546d18f50ae22bb06acd16df5; dfa784568c152310d6a5ecd0579bcd0a4637e14a; 6422c7126b6167c7f6a2a65bd367c447ad3f5bbd; 51cc6536e9c204b3e587029ec93bbc88a419d832; d260766429f6b64e270aa47d11851f6cb90d5e81; 70ee44786510db7c361aeaab6f37cc008bc9701e; fd0fd2db4e6dd941977559d38d552aae7d8db2b4; c121bb0a680dc632ff98bb7972b09ddb394516d5; 713a631f8f988b2a0dfd4eca014f93e7827189f7; 0879686f92dbdbe7a4e44c02afac1bf91843e4fd; e29d4343e49c759a17da1eabc47a37dc425aa0bb; 3eb24bcf65ea5c247a2355184ea486244f88d81c; 7c316f297d7c8f975bbd58d7181511ce7a718c1f; 66faabd7a6cfb3302c9fbd45fdbd32f080efbdef; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,Polish Journal of Medical Physics and Engineering,24,149 - 156
