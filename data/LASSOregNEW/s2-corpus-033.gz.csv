Our strategy involves two modeling approaches for the newly available data, one combining binary covariate selection via LASSO with logistic regression and one based on logic trees. The results of these models are then compared to the results of a model based on existing data with the objective of combining model results to achieve the most accurate predictions. The combination of model predictions is aided by the use of support vector machines to identify subspaces of the covariate space in which specific models lead to successful predictions.

a86e99efc7b586574cb8e65d0215a4dd43f2df12,Identification of clinically relevant features in hypertensive patients using penalized regression: a case study of cardiovascular events,"Appropriate management of hypertensive patients relies on the accurate identification of clinically relevant features. However, traditional statistical methods may ignore important information in datasets or overlook possible interactions among features. Machine learning may improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of regression models by identifying the most relevant features in hypertensive patients. We sought the most relevant features for prediction of cardiovascular (CV) events in a hypertensive population. We used the penalized regression models least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and elastic net (EN) to obtain the most parsimonious and accurate models. The clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers were collected from the clinical records of 1,471 patients receiving care at Mostoles University Hospital. The outcome was the development of major adverse CV events. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed alone and with penalized regression analyses (LASSO and EN), producing three models. The modeling was performed using 10-fold cross-validation to fit the penalized models. The three predictive models were compared and statistically analyzed to assess their classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, discriminative power, and calibration accuracy. The standard Cox model identified five relevant features, while LASSO and EN identified only three (age, LDL cholesterol, and kidney function). The accuracies of the models (prediction vs. observation) were 0.767 (Cox model), 0.754 (LASSO), and 0.764 (EN), and the areas under the curve were 0.694, 0.670, and 0.673, respectively. However, pairwise comparison of performance yielded no statistically significant differences. All three calibration curves showed close agreement between the predicted and observed probabilities of the development of a CV event. Although the performance was similar for all three models, both penalized regression analyses produced models with good fit and fewer features than the Cox regression predictive model but with the same accuracy. This case study of predictive models using penalized regression analyses shows that penalized regularization techniques can provide predictive models for CV risk assessment that are parsimonious, highly interpretable, and generalizable and that have good fit. For clinicians, a parsimonious model can be useful where available data are limited, as such a model can offer a simple but efficient way to model the impact of the different features on the prediction of CV events. Management of these features may lower the risk for a CV event.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in general biological processes and diseases pathogenesis. Identifying miRNA target genes is an essential step to fully understand the regulatory effects of miRNAs. Many computational methods based on the sequence complementary rules and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles have been developed for this purpose. It is noted that there have been many sequence features of miRNA targets available, including the context features of the target sites, the thermodynamic stability and the accessibility energy for miRNA-mRNA interaction. However, most of current computational methods that combine sequence and expression information do not effectively integrate full spectrum of these features; instead, they perceive putative miRNA-mRNA interactions from sequence-based prediction as equally meaningful. Therefore, these sequence features have not been fully utilized for improving miRNA target prediction.


RESULTS
We propose a novel regularized regression approach that is based on the adaptive Lasso procedure for detecting functional miRNA-mRNA interactions. Our method fully takes into account the gene sequence features and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Given a set of sequence features for each putative miRNA-mRNA interaction and their expression values, our model quantifies the down-regulation effect of each miRNA on its targets while simultaneously estimating the contribution of each sequence feature to predicting functional miRNA-mRNA interactions. By applying our model to the expression datasets from two cancer studies, we have demonstrated our prediction results have achieved better sensitivity and specificity and are more biologically meaningful compared with those based on other methods.

e0028cfdd47beb2b7ab1c8ec380ef08146dde8e8,Forecasting crude oil prices with a large set of predictors: Can LASSO select powerful predictors?,"Abstract In this paper, we use two prevailing shrinkage methods, the lasso and elastic net, to predict oil price returns with a large set of predictors. The out-of-sample results indicate that the lasso and elastic net models outperform a host of widely used competing models in terms of out-of-sample R-square and success ratio. In an asset allocation exercise, a meanâ€“variance investor obtains positive and sizeable economic gains based on the return forecasts of the lasso and elastic net methods relative to both the benchmark forecasts and competing forecasts. We further investigate the source of predictability from a variable selection perspective.

Our standard regression studies find that the effect of food-grain supplied has statistically significant effect on the dependent variable while the marginal effects of funds/money disbursed is not statistically significant. Using LASSO based Machine Learning techniques and after controlling for several correlated variables and state level factors we find that both policy variables - funds and food-grains however act as good out-of-sample predictors of number of children being covered. Evaluation of out-of-sample prediction performance of regression models and covariates is a very important but mostly an uncharted territory in development economics. Note that funds are used partly to provide fixed costs of the food service provided, and therefore it is not surprising that the coefficient estimate of this covariate (i.e., its marginal effect on dependent variable) does not appear to be statistically significant; but it can still act as a good overall predictor for our dependent variable.",2018,Economics,"list(name = ""Debasish Brahma"", ids = ""96690165""); list(name = ""Debjani Mukherjee"", ids = ""5124406"")",,,Applied Econometrics and International Development,18,141-152

An over-fitting problem can happen if there are too many explanatory variables inserted to regression model; in addition, there is a risk that the estimator is instable when there is multi-collinearity among the explanatory variables. For this reason, optimal variable selection based on high explanatory variables in box-office performance is of importance. Among the numerous ways to select variables, LASSO estimation applied by a generalized linear model has the smallest prediction error that can efficiently and quickly find variables with the highest explanatory power to box-office performance in order.",2013,Engineering,"list(name = ""Yon Hyong Kim"", ids = ""98814741""); list(name = ""Jeong Hong"", ids = ""143608341"")",d2564e1a18bef49c91a84104b2583e36c92b0a4c,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 2f0e3d1120ae70aa339cfd8da6f66058c1c6a7db; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; cf23104cb501a2617a5d7cac218b1d94fd44d0fa,,26,441-452
0ef3aece32bec22a756db91b2821eaee475a4e17,Smooth Image-on-Scalar Regression for Brain Mapping,"Brain mapping is an emerging tool in neurology and psychiatry researches for the realization of data-driven personalized medicine in the big data era. Taking images as responses, it learns the statistical links between brain images and subject level features. 
It is common practice to denoise the image before conducting any analysis, but at the risk of losing signals on small regions during the smooth stage. In this paper we propose {\it Smooth Image-on-scalar Regression} (SIR), a novel method for recovering the true association between an image outcome and scalar predictors. The estimator is achieved by minimizing a fidelity term plus a total variation (TV) regularization on the predicted mean image across all subjects. The proposed method bears connection to function-on-scalar regression with splines and graph fused lasso problems. We propose a provable convergent algorithm for the parameter estimation, which is efficient and can be easily combined with off-the-shell graph fused lasso solvers. The statistical consistency of the estimator is presented via an oracle inequality. 
Simulation results demonstrate that SIR outperforms existing methods, and is especially effective in recovering signals in heterogeneous region sizes. As an application, we apply SIR on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data and produce interpretable brain maps of the PET image to patient-level features include age, gender, genotype and disease groups, which matches recent medical findings.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bowei Yan"", ids = ""1912923""); list(name = ""Ying Liu"", ids = ""49421136"")",d7a8cb038d1d8c272e992fe529aab0287276ec5b; dc81342cf2c2c9d0727fe9a17d870bc56934b558,,arXiv: Methodology,,

In tomato, the generation and evaluation of large populations is an activity carried out by the breeder which produces increases in cost and time. The objective of this research was to compare the accuracy of phenotypic and marker-based selection for six traits related to fruit in a segregating population as well as to study the performance of several models of genomic selection. Results of the evaluation of six quantitative traits indicated that the prediction accuracies using ridge regression and Bayesian LASSO were greater in comparison to that obtained by multiple linear regression for the situations proposed. During the selection of the best genotypes at both F2 and F3 generations, in general, the phenotypic selection had higher genetic gains than those obtained by the strategies based on genomic selection and marker assisted selection.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Aurelio HernÃ¡ndez-Bautista"", ids = ""1404433520""); list(name = ""Ricardo Lobato-OrtÃ­z"", ids = ""1399876141""); list(name = ""JosÃ© JesÃºs GarcÃ­a-Zavala"", ids = ""1405055623""); list(name = ""Mayra Alicia Parra-GÃ³mez"", ids = ""1439479873""); list(name = ""Marisol Cadeza-Espinosa"", ids = ""1422413348""); list(name = ""Daniel Canela-DoÃ±an"", ids = ""1439480050""); list(name = ""SerafÃ­n Cruz-Izquierdo"", ids = ""1438837064""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Luis ChÃ¡vez-Servia"", ids = ""1403303668"")",85879580f67d4943c9ca286acd9b08959d4006ce; ed1e58210dbe72805bb127b6f4ed3912c6034f32; ecdb4eae9142338b3d723aacc88f04f52f73cc39,,Scientia Horticulturae,207,7-13
d49e6ae699cc4877d340e725f67d0c4b7bb751f5,Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Regularized Regression,"Motivation Associated with genomic features like gene expression, methylation, and genotypes, used in statistical modeling of health outcomes, there is a rich set of meta-features like functional annotations, pathway information, and knowledge from previous studies, that can be used post-hoc to facilitate the interpretation of a model. However, using this meta-feature information a-priori rather than post-hoc can yield improved prediction performance as well as enhanced model interpretation. Results We propose a new penalized regression approach that allows a-priori integration of external meta-features. The method extends LASSO regression by incorporating individualized penalty parameters for each regression coefficient. The penalty parameters are in turn modeled as a log-linear function of the meta-features and are estimated from the data using an approximate empirical Bayes approach. Optimization of the marginal likelihood on which the empirical Bayes estimation is based is performed using a fast and stable majorization-minimization procedure. Through simulations, we show that the proposed regression with individualized penalties can outperform the standard LASSO in terms of both parameters estimation and prediction performance when the external data is informative. We further demonstrate our approach with applications to gene expression studies of bone density and breast cancer.

However, nonlinearity and correlation among variables make it difficult to measure variable importance accurately. In this work, a novel variable importance measure, called regression and independence based variable importance (RIVI), is proposed. RIVI is designed by integrating Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) so that it is applicable to nonlinear systems. The results of two numerical examples demonstrate that RIVI is superior to several conventional measures including the Pearson correlation coefficient, PLS-Î², PLS-VIP, Lasso, HSIC, and permutation importance with random forest in the variable identification accuracy.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xinmin Zhang"", ids = ""47957227""); list(name = ""Takuya Wada"", ids = ""144243139""); list(name = ""Koichi Fujiwara"", ids = ""2756140""); list(name = ""Manabu Kano"", ids = ""145211674"")",,,Comput.

In many applications of the lasso, like in genomics, covariates are subject to measurement error. We study the impact of measurement error on linear regression with the lasso penalty, both analytically and in simulation experiments. A simple method of correction for measurement error in the lasso is then considered. In the large sample limit, the corrected lasso yields sign consistent covariate selection under conditions very similar to the lasso with perfect measurements, whereas the uncorrected lasso requires much more stringent conditions on the covariance structure of the data. Finally, we suggest methods to correct for measurement error in generalized linear models with the lasso penalty, which we study empirically in simulation experiments with logistic regression, and also apply to a classification problem with microarray data. We see that the corrected lasso selects less false positives than the standard lasso, at a similar level of true positives.

ad2f5e63cac43a283f65a196bb11973e4238fcaa,Association between biomarkers and clinical characteristics in chronic subdural hematoma patients assessed with lasso regression,"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is characterized by an ""old"" encapsulated collection of blood and blood breakdown products between the brain and its outermost covering (the dura). Recognized risk factors for development of CSDH are head injury, old age and using anticoagulation medication, but its underlying pathophysiological processes are still unclear. It is assumed that a complex local process of interrelated mechanisms including inflammation, neomembrane formation, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis could be related to its development and propagation. However, the association between the biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis, and the clinical and radiological characteristics of CSDH patients, need further investigation. The high number of biomarkers compared to the number of observations, the correlation between biomarkers, missing data and skewed distributions may limit the usefulness of classical statistical methods. We therefore explored lasso regression to assess the association between 30 biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis at the site of lesions, and selected clinical and radiological characteristics in a cohort of 93 patients. Lasso regression performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model. The results from the lasso regression showed analysis exhibited lack of robust statistical association between the biomarkers in hematoma fluid with age, gender, brain infarct, neurological deficiencies and volume of hematoma. However, there were associations between several of the biomarkers with postoperative recurrence requiring reoperation. The statistical analysis with lasso regression supported previous findings that the immunological characteristics of CSDH are local. The relationship between biomarkers, the radiological appearance of lesions and recurrence requiring reoperation have been inclusive using classical statistical methods on these data, but lasso regression revealed an association with inflammatory and angiogenic biomarkers in hematoma fluid. We thus suggest that lasso regression should be a recommended statistical method in research on biological processes in CSDH patients.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Are Hugo Pripp"", ids = ""3622896""); list(name = ""Milo StaniÅ¡iÄ‡"", ids = ""80446855"")",0d54f5f642a346aa678491e4739055124c0dc44a; 16453210f56a2b79072823e30220169c56e39767; 09ce2bcc2bc97d6aba0601649282227a9315129e,18d4d3006ad4b21ff3317fd61fcbb168e518a6ca; 59d250b5542743d22f322d07eaf7a55f827fd86b; 56f036a6faedd05667588b854feb898ff8bf5010; e0f7b7ac9c99500dbd53901b7462c59eded4f515; 9cd453a880cddb1c2e97f6bf12b84585c559a484; b96f3a3ef71c40e8be47e856dce3e4774b401112; 3d7eb849ea4cbd0ff2f397daad76cec4cd88b18e; b5e5a7eee59dd740897c0c3d1ada96c2e2a7e0a7; 6b5e99c128b9cd7b7fbc817a2843a47ce8a1c35d; 7dcb939eba37f14f393ff457943597599e85ca20; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; daf824ce49cb95d629f8cd448c0157a67592d474; 623c957cc85d373b323d8ac59c59f53c13efc49d; c98705d01db29f791839d636ac8ec42f9382b74a; 9f7d04f3cd77a44a54e4de820cf0e7cbab1f2cb0; 1cd25ddfafd2f5cfc9c03e428eba6c18fd8e127e; d06beff12882b1d315de1c5fecf09573d8f754f0; e868a1e770583d072ed0314b85a85b753b80ece4; d5c0806cbad8cbc018fc09226641bd5cef70a38b; 949cb16f4359cd33d535e3deeeec1d287a41d4e3; 97a280b37460ace7bbb44c538adc4716de966168; a7a63268d8dc0749a20b5673a1a62264bbffbea7; c6ab05b2a1c9b5bcf92457d4cc4901b400242248; 6fc599d0c8909c91eefe45bf06494ee922e81aa2; 2b3eb397fb7edaff0d6fae042190e210e28d7dce; f4a291d83e599562264760891c6fdd8007b36270; 204998d41c510ce42da4bd50853b8af9ab802837; ea67e29fea3988e0bc9f8c17b5a6db7e02f44eec; 53db4db464f53803c1c9a1907058504a93db49a7; 52e3e048d1ca3fe965261869a018ef0ba200c98c; 8973b7baded3247b7223b1508d3791211ab5cb7d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 239b44fd21c3f949f9fdf43bfedd4ab2a3d314e3; 9f50d40b597af03b3eb5792404e4822c8db7d33b; ef343d8b747b5e97143b84c0dd9ae893dc5acabf; 917bfacc0a477428303be4c1e1793ffd365ebd07; 165e62198e8dc47ddff8319be1f5344957df9272; 0c2f19f1c572449a4e9836d9d6e2c2e2e63fb234,PLoS ONE,12,
01bd53e3c12ee0f6fb9f26f594ff16352db59b4f,Stability selection for metabolomics data,"In the field of metabolomics, one aims to obtain a holistic view of all small molecules (metabolites), hopefully providing information on relevant biological processes in the system under study. Data are typically measured by hyphenated mass-spectrometry based detection, leading to thousands of variables for every sample. In the typical patient-control context, this means that we are performing many tests to find relevant differences between the two classes, with the unavoidable risk of false positives, or, alternatively, very little power. Stability selection (Meinshausen and Buehlmann, 2010), using the lasso as a primary variable selection method, provides a way to avoid many of the false positives in biomarker identification by repeatedly subsampling the data, and only considering those variables as putative biomarkers that consistently show up as important. In our own work, we have shown that also selecting the largest coefficients in non-sparse regression models such as PLS works well, when combined with the stability selection framework (Wehrens et al. 2011). We support these claims with the analysis of several experimental and simulated data sets. In particular, the BioMark package for R (Wehrens and Franceschi, 2012), implementing stability selection as well as Higher Criticism thresholding, contains an experimental spike-in data set from the area of metabolomics, which can aid in further algorithm testing and development. From these analyses, it follows that stability selection is a very general and robust framework for variable selection.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""H.R.M.J.

Methods: The ensemble method integrated a correlation method (Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC), a causal inference method (IDA) and a regression method (Lasso) utilizing the Borda count election method. Subsequently, to validate the performance of PIL method, comparisons between confirmed database and predicted miRNA targets were performed. Ultimately, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on target genes in top 1000 miRNA-mRNA interactions to identify target pathways for UM patients. Results: Thirty eight of the predicted interactions were matched with the confirmed interactions, indicating that the ensemble method was a suitable and feasible approach to predict miRNA targets. We obtained 50 seed miRNA-mRNA interactions of UM patients and extracted target genes from these interactions, such as ASPG, BSDC1 and C4BP. The 601 target genes in top 1,000 miRNA-mRNA interactions were enriched in 12 target pathways, of which Phototransduction was the most significant one.

Methods 765 high-risk women were followed at 4 monthly intervals for 27 months in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Associations of HIV-1 status (including CD4 count) and other potential risk factors with GW were assessed both at enrolment and throughout follow-up. We used Poisson regression and survival analysis techniques to identify factors associated with prevalent and incident GW. Results At enrolment, GW prevalence was 1.6% (8/492) among HIV seronegative, and 6.6% (18/273) among HIV-1 seropositive women (p 200 cells/Î¼l and 15.6 per 100 py among HIV-1 positive women with a CD4 count â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l (ptrend<0.001). Incidence was 3.6 per 100 py for women on HAART. At baseline, prevalent GW were strongly associated with smoking (adjusted OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.53â€“14.97; p=0.007). During follow-up, being HIV-1 infected with baseline CD4 â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l was the factor most strongly associated with incident GW (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 11.82, 95% CI 3.74â€“37.38; p<0.001). Concurrent bacterial vaginosis (aIRR 2.38, 95% CI 1.35â€“4.19; p=0.003), and genital ulceration (aIRR 3.34, 95% CI 1.49â€“7.49; p=0.003) were also associated with incident GW. There was weak evidence that concurrent HAART was protective against incident GW (aIRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19â€“1.29; p=0.15).

In NSABP B-41, pathologic complete response (pCR) was associated with prolonged survival among women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and lapatinib, trastuzumab, or the combination. We used a large human breast cancer gene expression panel to select candidate prognostic biomarkers for pCR among women treated with trastuzumab in NSABP B-41.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Eligible patients had a baseline pre-adjuvant treatment core biopsy sample, known pCR status, and no withdrawal of consent. We analyzed extracted RNA using the human nCounterÂ® Breast Cancer 360â„¢ gene expression panel. Gene counts were normalized to housekeeping genes and transformed into logarithmic scale with base two. To screen for candidate genes and meta-gene signatures prognostic of pCR, we used univariate logistic regression. Variable selection was done by multivariable logistic regression with lasso regularization.


RESULTS
Analyses of data from 130 patients revealed that a composite of gene expression from 19 genes and one gene signature appeared to predict pCR in women with HER2-positive early- stage breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab-containing regimens. The identified genes are involved in important pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, adhesion and migration, estrogen receptor signaling, DNA damage and repair, apoptosis, and proliferation. The AUC from a 10-fold cross validation on predicting pCR, with these 20 genomic markers in a logistic regression model, was 0.73.


CONCLUSIONS
The expression level of ERBB2, ESR1, and few other genomic markers was highly predictive of pCR after trastuzumab-containing regimens.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are common sexually transmitted infections (STI). We assessed the cumulative risk of NG and CT in a cohort of HIV-1-infected high-risk women taking antiretrovirals over 4 years in Burkina Faso.


METHODS
Between March 2007 and February 2011, participants were followed every 3-6 months. At each visit, participants underwent a gynaecological examination with collection of cervical and vaginal swabs. Random-effects logistic regression models were used to analyse associations of NG and CT infection with behavioural and biological factors.


RESULTS
172 women had samples tested for NG and CT during the study period, in a total of 1135 visits. NG was detected in 6.4% of women (11/172, 95% CI 2.7 to 10.1) at a rate of 2.76 cases (95% CI 1.53 to 4.99) per 100 person-years. CT was detected in 1.7% (3/172, 95% CI 0 to 3.7) of women at a rate of 0.75 cases (95% CI 0.24 to 2.34) per 100 person-years. The majority of women were asymptomatic (9/14). In the multivariable model, the presence of NG or CT was associated with tobacco use (aOR=11.85, 95% CI 1.13 to 124.17), and concurrent genital HIV-1 RNA shedding (aOR=4.78, 95% CI 1.17 to 19.46). Higher levels of education (aOR=0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.92), and age greater than 35 years (aOR=0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92) were associated with lower odds of infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The risk of NG or CT infection remains low among high-risk women in Bobo-Dioulasso. This provides some evidence that antiretroviral use does not contribute to behavioural disinhibition. The asymptomatic nature of most infections underscores the need for regular screening and treatment of STIs in core groups.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrea J.

To develop predictive models for late radiation-induced hematuria and nocturia allowing a patient individualized estimation of pre-treatment risk.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied 262 PCa patients treated with curative intensity modulated radiotherapy to the intact prostate or prostate bed. A total of 372 variables were used for prediction modeling, among which 343 genetic variations. Toxicity was scored using an in-house developed toxicity scale. Predictor selection is achieved by the EMLasso procedure, a penalized logistic regression method with an EM algorithm handling missing data and crossvalidation avoiding overfit. Model performance was expressed by the area under the curve (AUC) and by sensitivity and specificity.


RESULTS
Variables of the model predicting late hematuria (36/262) are bladder volume receiving â©¾75 Gy, prostatic transurethral resection and four polymorphisms. (AUC = 0.80, sensitivity = 83.3%, specificity = 61.5%). The AUC drops to 0.67 when the genetic markers are left out. The model that predicts for late nocturia (29/262) contains the minimal clinical target volume (CTV) dose, the CTV volume and three polymorphisms (AUC = 0.76, sensitivity = 75.9%, specify = 67.4%). This model is a better predictor for nocturia compared to the nongenetic model (AUC of 0.60).

We were able to develop models that predict for the occurrence of late radiation-induced hematuria and nocturia, including genetic factors which might improve the prediction of late urinary toxicity.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sofie De Langhe"", ids = ""4089226""); list(name = ""Gert De Meerleer"", ids = ""6588294""); list(name = ""Kim De Ruyck"", ids = ""134244237""); list(name = ""Piet Ost"", ids = ""5203562""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie Fonteyne"", ids = ""4132116""); list(name = ""Wilfried De Neve"", ids = ""1767857""); list(name = ""Hubert Thierens"", ids = ""3216762"")",5ea2b70d7dfdcfb2114725ffc197952ab8265087; 5764b851aae5dbf08ea3b269d6127fc1f6dec78a; 665a4c18e36c22894960a0738345fd94c9890e10; 35ae3a53baca2912122817082cd919392eb3505e; 6ea143d7fcef5a8021f76d9a16d144aea04f958d; f6684753904afb836125c5e34ff37b64bc078bed; fabc2d9d0a13c518469fecd9bc4f8cb59792908e; 416cc5f70d804e26e5033d7341e319cbbe9686d1; 3e624abc4ce9ba0f553816e79c8e764d87a84caa; 83899e40c1540cef5cb196bb1f50167035225b93; 9f1453152b5a18084d7cfc95e6a66f2fa3238f13; 0a4c247d816a5bd76af3e52cd11a721b9d341a8f; 9ba9ba0004bfc3f85b947b894c148b7807769fcd,,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,112 1,"

b47e2abe28711bac3bd0e7378c08ec71518aac15,Sparse Group Fused Lasso for Model Segmentation,"This article introduces the sparse group fused lasso (SGFL) as a statistical framework for segmenting high dimensional regression models. To compute solutions of the SGFL, a nonsmooth and nonseparable convex program, we develop a hybrid optimization method that is fast, requires no tuning parameter selection, and is guaranteed to converge to a global minimizer. In numerical experiments, the hybrid method compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of computation time and accuracy; benefits are particularly substantial in high dimension. The hybrid method is implemented in the R package sparseGFL available on the author's Github page.

d6bfd6d0c500c849bfa682117e482a5b8b51d989,Conjugate direction boosting for regression,"Boosting in the context of linear regression has gained additional attraction by the invention of least angle regression (LARS), where the connection between the lasso and forward stagewise fitting (boosting) was established. Earlier it has been found that boosting is a functional gradient optimization. Instead of the gradient method, we propose a conjugate direction method to minimize the residual sum of squares as a function of the regression coefficients. The result is a fast forward variable selection algorithm (CDBoost). The addition of shrinkage (small step-sizes) is only possible with an adjustment in form of a restart condition. For infinitesimal shrinkage this leads to an algorithm between forward stagewise fitting (boosting) and least angle regression. In particular, it also employs variable selection. While least angle regression seems to be restricted to linear regression, we can easily generalize our approach to arbitrary learners (fitting methods) like trees or splines, as for boosting. The learner is used to produce vectors of fitted values which can then be linearly fitted by CDBoost. The different methods are compared on simulated and real datasets. CDBoost achieves the best predictions mainly in complicated settings with correlated covariates, where it is difficult to assign how much a covariate contributes to the response. The gain of CDBoost over boosting is especially high in low and mid noise problems.",2004,,,,2210a7157565422261b03cf2cdf4e91b583df5a0; 8a6dc37432ebf535f6cc94d93c16d1529b0a7882; 68c1bfe375dde46777fe1ac8f3636fb651e3f0f8; b824cb051ffbdd81b529c4b82379a3af270fb6f7; f7103090b0bc74106025ac96b21b6ce5d1fb569c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 10179d638070a2f2381f917aeb27768b76cbe3f2; a92684c164b0c46020a371ae5116df74bb37a412; 7c63aeb09b0e0a2b20ed3154f66c9b6821132c53; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 7de372cae64dea5263076b5139c6b79df9e3157b,,,
e972a5ab8b52c625fe588523d4f88cd21cc8dcf1,Radiomics signature for prediction of lateral lymph node metastasis in conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma,"PURPOSE
Preoperative neck ultrasound (US) for lateral cervical lymph nodes is recommended for all patients undergoing thyroidectomy for thyroid malignancy, but it is operator dependent. We aimed to develop a radiomics signature using US images of the primary tumor to preoperatively predict lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (cPTC).


METHODS
Four hundred consecutive cPTC patients from January 2004 to February 2006 were enrolled as the training cohort, and 368 consecutive cPTC patients from March 2006 to February 2007 served as the validation cohort. A radiomics signature, which consisted of 14 selected features, was generated by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model in the training cohort. The discriminating performance of the radiomics signature was assessed in the validation cohort with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).


RESULTS
The radiomics signature was significantly associated with lateral cervical lymph node status (p < 0.001). The AUC of its performance in discriminating metastatic and non-metastatic lateral cervical lymph nodes was 0.710 (95% CI: 0.649-0.770) in the training cohort and was 0.621 (95% CI: 0.560-0.682) in the validation cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study showed that US radiomic features of the primary tumor were associated with lateral cervical lymph node status. Although their discriminatory performance was slightly lower in the validation cohort, our study shows that US radiomic features of the primary tumor alone have the potential to predict lateral LNM.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vivian Youngjean Park"", ids = ""35122986""); list(name = ""Kyunghwa Han"", ids = ""152742026""); list(name = ""Hye Jung Kim"", ids = ""35761672""); list(name = ""Eunjung Lee"", ids = ""38770814""); list(name = ""Ji Hyun Youk"", ids = ""4323045""); list(name = ""Eun-Kyung Kim"", ids = ""31697680""); list(name = ""Hee Jung Moon"", ids = ""3009033""); list(name = ""Jung Hyun Yoon"", ids = ""3435906""); list(name = ""Jin Young Kwak"", ids = ""1730548"")",,894944566fb04a0baae4e214be0d5167a848fb7c; 5820e69cbdebe65489b8060f5f3a342278948b83; 19ff01f3f864e5cc72e5e9654d07e4306021934d; 36624daee8d0e18806d16ed1b23fecdf7206e7d3; b9f6305568054c78d82e5191217c8baeb17a2284; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e8c89eeae5be6ac82bdd8360160cec1142515d3e; 8793d5cccc072aef1d816af58b27330288d55d01; 1761899d5bfee61a80b09ae75d2d47210aadd5b5; b7c6ebd257d0831aba44ad7e0a13d6f1aac1645b; 33b5dc6dbf371a1f02b1999f2aa473e9f39236f2; 10874aa79b82dd84e84c92c014cccabeb8421ff4; c8f5bf66b13374111df106bc1ab0f65790df332c; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; 619dcdce2a6ea9e8898eb5ddcdc38b7804420a19; ed60764e5cac48ae8072ef7ae5ec5fa749e158a1; 9a3a194c664132da64b8c78be426a44329e937bd; 5367631f29ac421d338cbb370eb2f58d9b99805b; ff5d20f3d9e858b14347213e71c92f1bd736bbe4; e66871eaa64a6d458e75e44c365edd260fd967cc; f62a7710d49c7c07a23300f6ddbd4c5ddc574926; 37ff104e270ce3e02c3b3903bbb435834cb975f2; 7a4201113dfc0eae6aaeca0778a259a90a8599a1; 4237874c3ce50ad261c61cc33164357736feb293; dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a; 4ed21bc831c16b57a0e979de900618f727d02aba; 9aace2d3651690f79b3879b6ad48c9aece7db2b2; 5c7104a145afa80c4190090cbaa3a0d7b7c10cf1; 638f04d32f533be6ac59b5b83ff073932b456baa; 0f683ae69681a6fc5490e1716228baf4c69106f5; 9e4c6df56eb991acc60117b4308c3f06c70c5307; 07aaee2e9278aa757d335da7e8ea3fb7aff59e3c,PLoS ONE,15,
374d973b0c28372dcd8d668b976a861d29652154,Exploiting Sparse User Activity in Multiuser Detection,"The number of active users in code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems is often much lower than the spreading gain. The present paper exploits fruitfully this a priori information to improve performance of multiuser detectors. A low-activity factor manifests itself in a sparse symbol vector with entries drawn from a finite alphabet that is augmented by the zero symbol to capture user inactivity. The non-equiprobable symbols of the augmented alphabet motivate a sparsity-exploiting maximum a posteriori probability (S-MAP) criterion, which is shown to yield a cost comprising the â„“2 least-squares error penalized by the p-th norm of the wanted symbol vector (p = 0, 1, 2). Related optimization problems appear in variable selection (shrinkage) schemes developed for linear regression, as well as in the emerging field of compressive sampling (CS). The contribution of this work to such sparse CDMA systems is a gamut of sparsity-exploiting multiuser detectors trading off performance for complexity requirements. From the vantage point of CS and the least-absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) spectrum of applications, the contribution amounts to sparsity-exploiting algorithms when the entries of the wanted signal vector adhere to finite-alphabet constraints.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hao Zhu"", ids = ""145153304""); list(name = ""Georgios B.

99feca29444807825e77a2fef030b26ec579453b,"Think global, act local when estimating a sparse precision matrix","Substantial progress has been made in the estimation
of sparse high dimensional precision matrices from scant datasets.
This is important because precision matrices underpin common tasks
such as regression, discriminant analysis, and portfolio
optimization. However, few good algorithms for this task exist
outside the space of L1 penalized optimization approaches like
GLASSO. This thesis introduces LGM, a new algorithm for the
estimation of sparse high dimensional precision matrices. Using the
framework of probabilistic graphical models, the algorithm performs
robust covariance estimation to generate potentials for small
cliques and fuses the local structures to form a sparse yet
globally robust model of the entire distribution. Identification of
appropriate local structures is done through stochastic discrete
optimization. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and
benchmarked against competitor algorithms for an array of synthetic
datasets. Simulation results suggest that LGM may outperform GLASSO
when model sparsity is especially important and when variables in
the dataset belong to a number of closely related (if unknown)
groups.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Peter A.

We performed quantum chemistry calculations on the coordination energy (Ecoord) of five alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) to electrolyte solvent, which is intimately related to ion transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Three regression methods, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and exhaustive search with linear regression (ES-LiR), were employed to find the relationship between Ecoord and descriptors. Descriptors include both ion and solvent properties, such as the radius of metal ions or the atomic charge of solvent molecules. Our results clearly indicate that the ionic radius and atomic charge of the oxygen atom that is connected to the metal ion are the most important descriptors. Good prediction accuracy for Ecoord of 0.127 eV was obtained using ES-LiR, meaning that we can predict Ecoord for any alkali ion without performing quantum chemistry calculations for ion-solvent pairs. Further improvement in the prediction accuracy was made by applying the exhaustive search with Gaussian process, which yields 0.016 eV for the prediction accuracy of Ecoord.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Atsushi Ishikawa"", ids = ""47834035""); list(name = ""Keitaro Sodeyama"", ids = ""2644648""); list(name = ""Yasuhiko Igarashi"", ids = ""2343588""); list(name = ""Tomofumi Nakayama"", ids = ""15688626""); list(name = ""Yoshitaka Tateyama"", ids = ""2603197""); list(name = ""Masato Okada"", ids = ""145029940"")",,,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,,
9b4d7c8f2f89f7d74b202405e900614641f842d7,Solution of linear ill-posed problems using random dictionaries,"In the present paper we consider application of overcomplete dictionaries to solution of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. In the context of regression problems, there have been enormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using such dictionaries. One of the most popular methods, Lasso and its versions, is based on minimizing empirical likelihood and, unfortunately, requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the, so called, compatibility conditions. While these conditions may be satisfied for the functions in the original dictionary, they usually do not hold for their images due to contraction imposed by the linear operator. Pensky (2016) showed that this difficulty can be bypassed by inverting each of the dictionary functions and matching the resulting expansion to the true function. However, even then the approach requires a compatibility condition which is difficult to check. In the present paper, we propose a solution which utilizes structured and unstructured random dictionaries, the technique that have not been applied so far to the solution of ill-posed linear inverse problems. We put a theoretical foundation under the suggested methodology and study its performance via simulations.",2016,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pawan Gupta"", ids = ""145778589""); list(name = ""Marianna Pensky"", ids = ""2734333"")",f173049510874fe14cc56de681e1f9206a75e707,2399029a4111e560f3f3925d6035408ba1542174; 19da2b7f74493b5a1f8876abcc3db2332a51f256; 294a83a978b38aa988459b099546b17b029492fe; c87a2498116cc9ee212677e7dfa954a6bacfbfa8; c6c06276881106fc53fc3e6f917341402e8280ed; 3770927e25cccbe5e0b20dd94d01f2c5dbe05003; 505526d0f1922cb1805826b134d74c3a97634427; c8122ce83bbac812ac0481ce6a8589d82690d51d; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; 7d78153a54988c1f305a673d596f9c1745d23946; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; f44a0c0015d8a28e42aea9b21f48fc2a30366def; 7f9ffc3a186204076ad3b7a9086d7104c79e5e06; 94cd3dc230246cb96ea79ae979f896cc87610a8b; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 3fd2c0f149c6a1321ac360e25a7d1487b34cead9,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,178-193

These methods exploit different nonsmooth loss functions to gain modeling flexibility, estimation robustness, and tuning insensitiveness. The developed solver is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is further accelerated by the multistage screening approach. The package flare is coded in double precision C, and called from R by a user-friendly interface. The memory usage is optimized by using the sparse matrix output.

The key condition is that the dimensionality pn can increase much faster than the sample size n, i.e. pn Ã€ n (in our case pn is the number of groups), but the number of relevant groups is small. The main conclusion is that many good properties from `1-regularization (Lasso) naturally carry on to the `1-`q cases (1 â‰¤ q â‰¤ âˆž), even if the number of variables within each group also increases with the sample size. With fixed design, we show that the whole family of estimators are both estimation consistent and variable selection consistent under different conditions. We also show the persistency result with random design under a much weaker condition. These results provide a unified treatment for the whole family of estimators ranging from q = 1 (Lasso) to q = âˆž (iCAP), with q = 2 (group Lasso)as a special case. When there is no group structure available, all the analysis reduces to the current results of the Lasso estimator (q = 1).",2015,,"list(name = ""Han Liu"", ids = ""49957601""); list(name = ""Jian Zhang"", ids = ""50561911"")",be8ea8aed48769d78a313bf1cbc979b6efdf92a5,7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; b01c2d38e27614b657d77bc6512bc132b04baf5b; efda42d821605707c89aebc3912da4748f3d02ce; 61017d4ea4aaa53f78b4dddbf29db65d62d9f811; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 34782520d452ef0f943c2c758d9ec8ef40b7461b; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; f24d15247fe922982c7e3478db36c94825619395; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 66f5f763f5f868e529ee81edf5b9957043f7a6fb; 7106fcaa56b5434d933c6985db379788a723f5f0; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 7aa39f7f3b69473705e247dd2b3a9689f10fbbc3; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 3629fffcb9cb96462524bf3b77ff2ebfb634dbea; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; 9af121fbed84c3484ab86df8f17f1f198ed790a0; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; e40b44e4f20d185a9b09e29ffd11cb0f5977b63b; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 84d098300fa328eb98e920474a1b1fa890cd23d5; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c,,,
a60940aa2145d5028bd73146e3640d80f592a66f,A new perspective on least squares under convex constraint,"Consider the problem of estimating the mean of a Gaussian random vector when the mean vector is assumed to be in a given convex set. The most natural solution is to take the Euclidean projection of the data vector on to this convex set; in other words, performing ""least squares under a convex constraint."" Many problems in modern statistics and statistical signal processing theory are special cases of this general situation. Examples include the lasso and other high-dimensional regression techniques, function estimation problems, matrix estimation and completion, shape-restricted regression, constrained denoising, linear inverse problems, etc. This paper presents three general results about this problem, namely, (a) an exact computation of the main term in the estimation error by relating it to expected maxima of Gaussian processes (existing results only give upper bounds), (b) a theorem showing that the least squares estimator is always admissible up to a universal constant in any problem of the above kind and (c) a counterexample showing that least squares estimator may not always be minimax rate-optimal. The result from part (a) is then used to compute the error of the least squares estimator in two examples of contemporary interest.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sourav Chatterjee"", ids = ""47321046"")",db074c0fdaa60c85bbafaad94c5ec5a9ad162a7b; c69509f67ee5471aa4d4179a1e0b2247e9d1a3f0; 7de50ca35b8ee85fc72e602d97c4c4afa21130b7; 20bd4c70f9f510dc31d97954c5162d603900c853; 28bc107ddca15ab74ad29518fada2976da4e2708; 1eca7bce8e67e7fa5907e93a60f21817fe57bcd7; 3947220133b9b73f4653088769d9624536538d47; 9a45f70f9d5e60a8b64bf3a893c5b983b2110c7c; 6fa62d714ea415cae6acf4286c0ea59337d3264b; 89795e4859557b3cfa0ab6bd533428988bfd7ad0; 635260718cae1ac38625275e4a44f84990b3601f; 592f65f1ab8d4949d53bc1f94ab8cd1f53caf7b0; 7c6e3469c84c74fb5a12eaf8c9880ee86336f255; cf154a5889291b92a19a7bd3fe4ed15f69a94bb9; 37643ea113a80664b24e8b57d5105850199051f8; 4d9e766685882c9ff7f51ee0ec150d7e7b960240; 06686e02a46ffd38cbaee12b667fae3f7e99b7d4; a956dacd2d13f937e3dc58252b99b99b4d721eff; 73c169ef693554f7b0a7af799da33192aaf75ec7; 544c5730c81b78b7e13df5d3db11ee8878e24542; 2aea2cd52adfde69cf98e8eb267c349edc3470fc; 899ae6c8dcb81ab34bbc4d8aae8ac5ca8c7e81c2; 47dec11b1cef0e054b58f8432fb7047413437bc4; 79a4cb13a7403dae953f7ced3bd895e3b43af918; 73130b288f53074c1b2d4e07509d6275023a0241; 7fae612d76443baa4dc66f022a1be0f936585220; 4943f505f5d32421d18cd67978f5661832c1239c; b765f27174f16e5e59bbe173d66ad16e21bd2a4b; 6aae15bd03ad803eba2792b856f1d314af8fbdca; 4dc4c582c9880acfdc4ec4447857b9463e87ad92; 4e27d63d4087b778df788a548c1adbf268b6ebd1; c1aa35d8ff85d055006b1c214ba6a193b6438dc2; 58fd5f35adfde5229f9e4a49187c2efca48a4f66; 0589e4bcd10142f1f1fcecf300d40a0bfdcbe417; 6c8a33de8a989bbec4a86fa86fa01a6b272c8ce2; 215ceede776aae05b3bd578570c042f0f4ece8e7; 60c42451891e56d12127e9e8535fd3c3a97ca3e4; 88f0f21e51b89559c01db5a922c4e10c1578ee2b; 97eb2e0561522dfffe02f0a23d5ee8e0103cd0fa; 3d1f18e1114f05485deefa7b89366278653c85ee; 7d10e6873d48f7dc12fa0aaa797ddf1557a93a04; 32c713cb936bb79811ae6a1427f350ba96f5d66e; 8367795eed6be236beda9032f317b7fc218b10aa; 9d08e2a4fd460701f1c0181e794cd0c34c18e7ca; 8c1c86609641fcbbd11381415fd03892132259c2; 98298332ec688f0bbcdce7c9c9e2ea7545530e6f; a8a55766b61e2a122c0153cf1fc3a0cdbacbc2bd; 6f47f2222dc394bdf8284a0ed2f8565e4f59956e; 8b5ad19c547c7141f4e86b567f23dac9c3af227b,,Annals of Statistics,42,2340-2381
