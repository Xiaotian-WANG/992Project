bea9889a64a7c23cdeb81d0d2363f536ad8a5ae1,Hierarchical shrinkage in time-varying parameter models,"In this paper, we forecast EU-area inflation with many predictors using time-varying parameter models. The facts that time-varying parameter models are parameter-rich and the time span of our data is relatively short motivate a desire for shrinkage. In constant coefficient regression models, the Bayesian Lasso is gaining increasing popularity as an effective tool for achieving such shrinkage. In this paper, we develop econometric methods for using the Bayesian Lasso with time-varying parameter models. Our approach allows for the coefficient on each predictor to be: i) time varying, ii) constant over time or iii) shrunk to zero. The econometric methodology decides automatically which category each coefficient belongs in. Our empirical results indicate the benefits of such an approach.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Belmonte Miguel"", ids = ""120304028""); list(name = ""Koop Gary"", ids = ""71859819""); list(name = ""Korobilis Dimitris"", ids = ""144626590"")",60fa63da9a9c94f99119f622af5d810f26422ae6; aa037e368693fe47048f725cefeb7ea6d3b07228; 2e7f9321749e23868b81377af50bbbe3cdbfef06; c1dec50180bad4981c6c03e5d4312085091e5678; 2a89ea0d71c90cd3590f236d6c51ba89d46151a3; 302efe3f373e7ddbb628260f8a577874ddaea4a1; ca2ee935bfc49d6a2b37258f1bfe7c46c15ece77; 125075db7b38b72e7cf226a01dd68e3908a527b9; dd9255a72fd20b4ebeddae38cab78c164e84289c; 98f7dc2df2a5478795160a87c0b8af9353bda03d; 87d473326a82771c4b81fd19272d18fd4d82f268; 1aa196cfa6654f8796a5bbccba942bf0d03492e7; c8258485dab807a25a748fe2f4f74abbbc6c7db0; 9ee4741ff5ac8731e10b26f26bb49c9d2150399e; 0f8d4d4460ebca00bac0fced7511e7da7dbdc703; 957d6ec570bf367af0a8a63970775b867e37c363; 58c03f5464e4e654fc1f7e226df5e83f7a51c3e6; 8c51bc999a9f22da4b79dcf45a81dff40b509675; 62b2d59a9a35933bcbc722f480db8574d4a2d766; 8b1538bdb526c43e86b46e10e9fbac911ee5c52b; 64af1b5da4acd415178ff10cd48d53b67c88e932; 8e8f5221a424ec80655edfd99dc6cbb6a84a632e; 139a83d38d41dab2d4fa9404669b3b3bdff08ee5; fd24e7ed08a8ac59532355a84c19657969f2e77c; 6900ad7412a71467cc8e036fb7a57b5dd9fabacf; c52fd640e716cec4942c9fe533eb1a9b1de75f1c; 0a271862d88868f2b88bf18e6a02c9478cd400fc; 19730319df817d9f31cd335d690f29ffe3664125; 2c14bc1155fafc4426a31d123a370694503f8f19; 70c25bf375e5c30ea003527121603eca2e3f5710; 9c891f9a3140fbff8742ecbcdf39c6e4dd274ac4; 5b8cd6abb0c23d909e8fc233008a53ab8aafaff5; 47f99b5226a8803e06cffae990df5344491ff9e1; 80d245defedf740381a14385a24ed8ce08941ed7; 9eca57ccfad611d41b88f2463ca82e8d427e8980; b5820ff953e0740deb91b7acbb632c98480bf7d9; 5012e7ed8ef5a422555fd2aa11ee2ceac618694a; bd1b4f9f5916b580bfe604bbd30e504c2c9968fa; 97ce7f05e77837a9048ee9160038ab1d37550cc3; a0f54061be72780e1719279f23c06303e14c1717; d3f032d819603b74a1d2aa39318497f4c1a5edf2; 78f0fe868dab0497b256bb1f2b849325db14c265; c40fa266948565ca1e5c122968af4aee95b0f0a7; b043310d7a94df4b137f9b76679badee29d260d3; 64947e5fdd79abdcc65e17a876c765060a8a065f; 460c2759d522826761c97975aa84e6ba381fb8f4; dbc3dd069ea5be91f8893cb5e98b044eb735c34b; 56286914d741db60e7c414580ef4ec345964509b; 33f0aa2fae23db5be6e3adc79b27b5e2acaaf795; 66f4ec56af0c9fb4e429ec55a5c48df64bd8acf0; 8afd6b2df701ec343287d51c2779465ea80fc271; e0477538fbb47f718b50a389b383a4b0eaa9963d; 9a63fc7832d6c8bc7caf990d5960b7fd09d82b05; ce0d8ce3e6d03abc48bd0f1041fd4c519b23438f; b4f29894369736188f9ed69ca336ab3abaf045d2,d8d8dae44ef43be562fec56ca49b7f2f7f532354; e49d5fb11e4f8004f57fc2346f67887fee0e4248; a5b40921ae03cc6fa34f532173a23c321c9ad3f7; da9df5d83da5f948e6bbc4e8ae3fe144044bf0e7; 9a88f6a95cf1f19145699175e11845d7dc2808ae; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 998e7af5eb2865f05f951a8d48d509c1ce83236c; 93f3843c185f3a1a79e6aef89e9b06b4eaee00fc; 1d189a836b92b4fd21bd201c0c75fba70ddedd0f; 8dbc78c1ff1742643f32c9b4d37e64b494fb719a; dd83e6c0a42c48b19791021327893878ea81f491; 1c09bd84249a3b10203bce631374786e043c0a7d; 744b0d6f6cf99f9053ffabf8cc9cc7b572e2b8a2; 86538fc7c3f214772414fdbb366e19099b115fab; 917d8472fc08b50ed13f1af9ff1b684310d12fef; d7632aa87f9d79857919cbfe97ddb80795c5a93e; dde472c84d6a74e7b0a604f59dde3574f13d5b4f; ae47336de60524df45e540683188ffea79ff5510; f1d31247b64dd2d824653dd0ef529e80b911a083; 5f7ba9f7fb9084d59c794491c3e9dcec30e8ede3; fb654c2858b01169b23769f182e79fe9d2407b83; 8cc6bd4a0947afa35cf02fb4778f1fe76cef39f5,,,
882968a5708fd193731f08dad8aa66c427eb1acd,"Dykstra's Algorithm, ADMM, and Coordinate Descent: Connections, Insights, and Extensions","We study connections between Dykstra's algorithm for projecting onto an intersection of convex sets, the augmented Lagrangian method of multipliers or ADMM, and block coordinate descent. We prove that coordinate descent for a regularized regression problem, in which the (separable) penalty functions are seminorms, is exactly equivalent to Dykstra's algorithm applied to the dual problem. ADMM on the dual problem is also seen to be equivalent, in the special case of two sets, with one being a linear subspace. These connections, aside from being interesting in their own right, suggest new ways of analyzing and extending coordinate descent. For example, from existing convergence theory on Dykstra's algorithm over polyhedra, we discern that coordinate descent for the lasso problem converges at an (asymptotically) linear rate. We also develop two parallel versions of coordinate descent, based on the Dykstra and ADMM connections.",2017,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ryan J.

a780c5ced6182f8367a07a925fc0e330f88a5269,A pilot study on patient-related costs and factors associated with the cost of specialist palliative care in the hospital: first steps towards a patient classification system in Germany,"BackgroundSpecialist palliative care in the hospital addresses a heterogeneous patient population with complex care needs. In Germany, palliative care patients are classified based on their primary diagnosis to determine reimbursement despite findings that other factors describe patient needs better. To facilitate adequate resource allocation in this setting, in Australia and in the UK important steps have been undertaken towards identifying drivers of palliative care resource use and classifying patients accordingly. We aimed to pioneer patient classification based on determinants of resource use relevant to specialist palliative care in Germany first, by calculating the patient-level cost of specialist palliative care from the hospitalâ€™s perspective, based on the recorded resource use and, subsequently, by analysing influencing factors.MethodsCross-sectional study of consecutive patients who had an episode of specialist palliative care in Munich University Hospital between 20 June and 4 August, 2016. To accurately reflect personnel intensity of specialist palliative care, aside from administrative data, we recorded actual use of all involved health professionalsâ€™ labour time at patient level. Factors influencing episode costs were assessed using generalized linear regression and LASSO variable selection.ResultsThe study included 144 patients. Mean costs of specialist palliative care per palliative care unit episode were 6542â‚¬ (median: 5789â‚¬, SE: 715â‚¬) and 823â‚¬ (median: 702â‚¬, SE: 31â‚¬) per consultation episode. Based on multivariate models that considered both variables recorded at beginning and at the end of episode, we identified factors explaining episode cost including phase of illness, Karnofsky performance score, and type of discharge.ConclusionsThis study is an important step towards patient classification in specialist palliative care in Germany as it provides a feasible patient-level costing method and identifies possible starting points for classification. Application to a larger sample will allow for meaningful classification of palliative patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Becker"", ids = ""50262920""); list(name = ""Reiner Leidl"", ids = ""2778748""); list(name = ""Eva Schildmann"", ids = ""7311347""); list(name = ""Farina Hodiamont"", ids = ""3538231""); list(name = ""Claudia Bausewein"", ids = ""4197913"")",487fcb34498cf4e967d06e7a6f2e25773279770b,0d25f9c819831c7b3c37ec96204e5bd35c32f119; fd56d64ca22f5277ca90300e6455092d02b68e8b; 62fd5b8e7ff41a1a9db799a517a281679d2b811a; ec5be6f5d9dc9390936c565bdbc9ef5c6d197f9d; f7e82e024817614d4d2faf07982531ef40a4cda6; 07f2a3661a8b570c3b1ebaab17744bddc252b460; 11ac48d67fcf488ae944d6793fdd9df0e0f62cd8; 58ef93397f7905258ce29900a24fec3b949827de; 144d790a1bbecfac7ba7abfd43ae9ee6ae9332be; 1c12799a48d6d93bc9e233c57d12f4d3087e0ee0; e5d7c0094bdf733e92e16c29d54afbd5b45370b7; 62baad4113dac37587aa819c7b1c122d9be43a67; fbd5d903b75421c3b83d9733e6b29ca05f02a202; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 852471a2ae1e160e5d478fe791eae747946d3f95; 2021ec6879d727ecc9b58f29085e59da734f3cea; 7da6d90229d23896bc2ea4e8286f8f92b0ffb90f; 276bddba6546ddee7bd2dfb1b889506518fe64c7; b6dff0f9d6b2d2686860bce5559371ed80b91dc1; dfc6d391ad040994cc26f7674da3613874648df7; 99b2bf75b108e7132ffef14c727eec6d57b4ff10; 456b6bde37a5c4cd2dd6d0abd66fa48bf1bce4f7; 066ba3bb99c463bc5876e0397a04573e562f6899; 19738d6e4a6bae1d8ebdb8797714e518d6704e53; 6217ab14a028f4bc897dd93724fb9ffbc0a155a7; cb4127d5f0837ba1f3e1e720df63ccd4eea22ba1; 7d1bfdadc5f1a9567121d9740e6d1849e3a63e40,Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation : C/E,16,

179a6dcc9f8365c3326486b5c215d17d5dacfdb4,Computational Intelligence Modeling of the Macromolecules Release from PLGA Microspheresâ€”Focus on Feature Selection,"Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) is a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acid. Drug release from PLGA microspheres depends not only on polymer properties but also on drug type, particle size, morphology of microspheres, release conditions, etc. Selecting a subset of relevant properties for PLGA is a challenging machine learning task as there are over three hundred features to consider. In this work, we formulate the selection of critical attributes for PLGA as a multiobjective optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the error of predicting the dissolution profile while reducing the number of attributes selected. Four bio-inspired optimization algorithms: antlion optimization, binary version of antlion optimization, grey wolf optimization, and social spider optimization are used to select the optimal feature set for predicting the dissolution profile of PLGA. Besides these, LASSO algorithm is also used for comparisons. Selection of crucial variables is performed under the assumption that both predictability and model simplicity are of equal importance to the final result. During the feature selection process, a set of input variables is employed to find minimum generalization error across different predictive models and their settings/architectures. The methodology is evaluated using predictive modeling for which various tools are chosen, such as Cubist, random forests, artificial neural networks (monotonic MLP, deep learning MLP), multivariate adaptive regression splines, classification and regression tree, and hybrid systems of fuzzy logic and evolutionary computations (fugeR). The experimental results are compared with the results reported by SzlÈ©k.

4ac8c553765495313df0c13a9c57e5f618166194,Predicting clinically promising therapeutic hypotheses using tensor factorization,"BackgroundDetermining which target to pursue is a challenging and error-prone first step in developing a therapeutic treatment for a disease, where missteps are potentially very costly given the long-time frames and high expenses of drug development. With current informatics technology and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to computationally discover therapeutic hypotheses by predicting clinically promising drug targets based on the evidence associating drug targets with disease indications. We have collected this evidence from Open Targets and additional databases that covers 17 sources of evidence for target-indication association and represented the data as a tensor of 21,437â€‰Ã—â€‰2211â€‰Ã—â€‰17.ResultsAs a proof-of-concept, we identified examples of successes and failures of target-indication pairs in clinical trials across 875 targets and 574 disease indications to build a gold-standard data set of 6140 known clinical outcomes. We designed and executed three benchmarking strategies to examine the performance of multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, LASSO, Random Forest, Tensor Factorization and Gradient Boosting Machine. With 10-fold cross-validation, tensor factorization achieved AUROCâ€‰=â€‰0.82â€‰Â±â€‰0.02 and AUPRCâ€‰=â€‰0.71â€‰Â±â€‰0.03. Across multiple validation schemes, this was comparable or better than other methods.ConclusionIn this work, we benchmarked a machine learning technique called tensor factorization for the problem of predicting clinical outcomes of therapeutic hypotheses. Results have shown that this method can achieve equal or better prediction performance compared with a variety of baseline models. We demonstrate one application of the method to predict outcomes of trials on novel indications of approved drug targets. This work can be expanded to targets and indications that have never been clinically tested and proposing novel target-indication hypotheses. Our proposed biologically-motivated cross-validation schemes provide insight into the robustness of the prediction performance.

0dbf27ef9a590b4ed3b2d2af18f9a722a2168cd5,"Prospective prediction of suicide attempts in community adolescents and young adults, using regression methods and machine learning.","BACKGROUND
The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to study suicidality has recently been recommended. Our aim was to explore whether ML approaches have the potential to improve the prediction of suicide attempt (SA) risk. Using the epidemiological multiwave prospective-longitudinal Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) data set, we compared four algorithms-logistic regression, lasso, ridge, and random forest-in predicting a future SA in a community sample of adolescents and young adults.


METHODS
The EDSP Study prospectively assessed, over the course of 10 years, adolescents and young adults aged 14-24 years at baseline. Of 3021 subjects, 2797 were eligible for prospective analyses because they participated in at least one of the three follow-up assessments. Sixteen baseline predictors, all selected a priori from the literature, were used to predict follow-up SAs. Model performance was assessed using repeated nested 10-fold cross-validation. As the main measure of predictive performance we used the area under the curve (AUC).


RESULTS
The mean AUCs of the four predictive models, logistic regression, lasso, ridge, and random forest, were 0.828, 0.826, 0.829, and 0.824, respectively.

Based on our comparison, each algorithm performed equally well in distinguishing between a future SA case and a non-SA case in community adolescents and young adults. When choosing an algorithm, different considerations, however, such as ease of implementation, might in some instances lead to one algorithm being prioritized over another.

7bd34e7f6da0808e93f3a41fa80dfc707f4c67d5,Serum miRNA-based Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold-standard procedure for evaluating axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with breast cancer. However, the morbidity of SLNB is not negligible, and the procedure is invasive for patients without ALN metastasis. Here, we developed a diagnostic model for evaluating ALN status using a combination of serum miRNAs and clinicopathologic factors as a novel less-invasive biomarker.Experimental Design: Preoperative serum samples were collected from patients who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer or breast benign diseases between 2008 and 2014. A total of 958 serum samples (921 cases of primary breast cancer, including 630 cases in the no ALN metastasis group and 291 cases in the ALN metastasis group, and 37 patients with benign breast diseases) were analyzed by miRNA microarray. Samples were randomly divided into training and test sets. Logistic LASSO regression analysis was used to construct diagnostic models in the training set, which were validated in the test set.


RESULTS
An optimal diagnostic model was identified using a combination of two miRNAs (miR-629-3p and miR-4710) and three clinicopathologic factors (T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and ultrasound findings), which showed a sensitivity of 0.88 (0.84-0.92), a specificity of 0.69 (0.61-0.76), an accuracy of 0.818, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 in the test set.


CONCLUSIONS
Serum miRNA profiles may be useful for the diagnosis of ALN metastasis before surgery in a less-invasive manner than SLNB.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sho Shiino"", ids = ""81462183""); list(name = ""Juntaro Matsuzaki"", ids = ""33031261""); list(name = ""Akihiko Shimomura"", ids = ""2326081""); list(name = ""Junpei Kawauchi"", ids = ""40068695""); list(name = ""Satoko Takizawa"", ids = ""6159730""); list(name = ""Hiromi Sakamoto"", ids = ""2245993""); list(name = ""Yoshiaki Aoki"", ids = ""2538881""); list(name = ""Masayuki Yoshida"", ids = ""50244228""); list(name = ""Kenji Tamura"", ids = ""144894554""); list(name = ""Ken Kato"", ids = ""2673219""); list(name = ""Takayuki Kinoshita"", ids = ""5597541""); list(name = ""Yuko Kitagawa"", ids = ""2043840""); list(name = ""Takahiro Ochiya"", ids = ""6051229"")",a212fe00567089e717a128c300d07e93c971db80; cfeb711df53df4653052ff3b3a9dbda4ecac52a3,,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,25 6,"

edad7ebcfa3972ae3ba17c0a3ffdc35967463790,An Additive Sparse Penalty for Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Linear Regression Model,"We consider a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model. Penalized methods using LASSO or nonconvex penalties have been widely used for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional regression models. In penalized regression, the selection and prediction performances depend on which penalty function is used. For example, it is known that LASSO has a good prediction performance but tends to select more variables than necessary. In this paper, we propose an additive sparse penalty for variable selection using a combination of LASSO and minimax concave penalties (MCP). The proposed penalty is designed for good properties of both LASSO and MCP. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute the proposed estimator by combining a concave convex procedure and coordinate descent algorithm. Numerical studies show that the proposed method has better selection and prediction performances compared to other penalized methods.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sangin Lee"", ids = ""8568898"")",,,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods,22,147-157
b01c2d38e27614b657d77bc6512bc132b04baf5b,Grouped and Hierarchical Model Selection through Composite Absolute Penalties,"Extracting useful information from high-dimensional data is an important part of the focus of todayâ€™s statistical research and practice. Penalized loss function minimization has been shown to be eective for this task both theoretically and empirically. With the virtues of both regularization and sparsity, the L1-penalized L2 minimization method Lasso has been popular in regression models. In this paper, we combine dierent norms including L1 to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information to the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable estimates. Specifically, we introduce the Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP) family which allows the grouping and hierarchical relationships between the predictors to be expressed. CAP penalties are built by defining groups and combining the properties of norm penalties at the across group and within group levels. Grouped selection occurs for non-overlapping groups. In that case, we give a Bayesian",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peng Zhao"", ids = ""46737459""); list(name = ""Guilherme V.

d160c694ee1f5acaef48c0e5d200a7d9138575ec,Model selection via the lasso in conditional logistic regression,"We propose a model selection procedure in the context of matched case-control studies and, more specifically, for the conditional logistic regression. The method is based on penalized conditional likelihood with an L1-type penalty of the regression coefficients, the so-called lasso. This penalty, which shrinks coefficients to improve the accuracy of prediction, is particularly adapted when the number of covariates is large (with respect to the number of events) or in case of collinearity between them. An attractive property of the lasso is that it performs parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously. The implementation of the method is based on a simple modification of the R-package ""penalized"" for fitting generalized linear and Cox proportional hazard models with L1 or L2 penalties, developed by J. Goeman. The effectiveness of the algorithms allows the use of resampling methods for choosing the regularization term and for evaluating the stability of the selected model. Thus, K-fold likelihood cross-validation and bootstrap are applied, both taking into account the dependent nature of data. The methodology is illustrated with some examples.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marta Avalos"", ids = ""144150465"")",559dfd6fa107e455233b4541197047e90ba5ac23; 82349055ac661cb6ef5893a83194e436d2cf584d,,,,

Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. These models were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying this behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to symptoms of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Lucas L Dwiel"", ids = ""4125230""); list(name = ""Michael A Connerney"", ids = ""5769947""); list(name = ""Alan I Green"", ids = ""40099196""); list(name = ""Jibran Y.

66be13f084a1806a12b6d9afd4c23694a896071c,[Contrast-enhanced CT and texture analysis of mass-forming pancreatitis and cancer in the pancreatic head].,"Objective: To explore the value of contrast-enhanced CT combined with texture analysis in differentiating pancreatic cancer from mass-forming pancreatitis in pancreatic head. Methods: A retrospective study collected 21 patients with pancreatic head mass-forming pancreatitis confirmed by surgery or biopsy and 47 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma confirmed by surgery. The patients visited the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College between January 2014 and December 2017. Gender, age and CT findings were collected. The parenchymal phase was selected for texture analysis. The minimum absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied for dimensionality reduction.Two independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test were used for continuous variables based on the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results. Categorical variables were tested by Chi-square or Fisher test. By multivariable regression analysis, CT findings, CT texture analysis, CT findings combined with texture analysis prediction models were established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of individual indicators and each prediction model. The Delong test was used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of each model. Results: The CT findings prediction model consisted of CT value of lesion on pancreatic parenchymal phase and pancreatic duct penetrating sign. The texture analysis prediction model consists of root mean square and low grey level run emphasis_angle135. The AUC of them were not statistically different (Z=0.150,P>0.05). The combined predictive model had the better diagnostic performance (AUC 0.944, sensitivity 83.0%, specificity 95.2%, +LR 17.43, -LR 0.18) than CT sign prediction model (Z=2.008, P<0.05) and texture analysis prediction model(Z=2.236, P<0.05) were significantly different. Conclusions: The CT findings model and the texture analysis model have equivalent diagnostic performance in the differentiation of mass-forming pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.

Linear regression models with sparsity have various applications in many real-world processes, including signal processing, image processing, gene selection and comparative genomic hybridization. Commonly, it involves heavy computation for combinatorial search for finding such models with sparsity by model selection. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a popular technique for model selection and estimation in linear regression to induce sparsity. In this thesis, we study several general LASSO models, including group LASSO, sparse group LASSO and fused LASSO. We focus on the applications of alternating direction method (ADM) of multipliers to these LASSO models, including the applications of ADM to LASSO and group LASSO, and a linearized version of ADM to sparse group LASSO and fused LASSO. This approach can solve large scale problems efficiently.

Quantile regression for binary response data has recently attracted attention and regularized quantile regression methods have been proposed for high dimensional problems. When the predictors have a natural group structure, such as in the case of categorical predictors converted into dummy variables, then a group lasso penalty is used in regularized methods. In this paper, we present a Bayesian Gibbs sampling procedure to estimate the parameters of a quantile regression model under a group lasso penalty for classification problems with a binary response. Simulated and real data show a good performance of the proposed method in comparison to mean-based approaches and to quantile-based approaches which do not exploit the group structure of the predictors.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hussein Hashem"", ids = ""145062900""); list(name = ""Veronica Vinciotti"", ids = ""3173242""); list(name = ""Rahim Alhamzawi"", ids = ""3295721""); list(name = ""Keming Yu"", ids = ""2271096"")",01cff017d34ca6d7552d354dc836d1430f3d6718; ada3a0549c8628c15a7e84d4c053439596e72cda; e35d9c89120cc2557d7ac767c28cc8a94912c2de; 9137924feaeea30699506ef52b4cd2d356a54819; abc48ed7627c290a82d9e01e15a030e2452c8385,d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; bca3bc3708a657cc6775a649ba5e31837ba836a6; afe063a66b7dfe2503052026843f3cfc1e62539f; 7330366efb83b3daaa5d0773862d67917d8fef03; c09db7439505f49a0958f68e782df94b3807341a; 1755bbf1ae01521f53927a8361f70e81cb15412c; 73e6d410f380af0ed85a5284952a8d01047f1e86; ec71ad8b8ef0a72955991601039555ad13258a97; 1686a6abc8d06927671281d6be49e602c70df41c; 6c4feafb078ae9f43c05ed3e5fa636edd95227a4; 91417036889f743818d6b93b4e567bb59136d485; 4ab7bf0b6b9ffc31fb3db558b25176616483b42f; 585b4192d1d0926b8ff0428666ea1bd5f64db4af; 35a74d5c81df68b9923642551c740c6873117e52; 7e1ce7efcb0fa493d19feb8333c76293410ce90f; c74f3c797a2238d0a40fdce8dd201789bbc1242a; 93dae24361ee06a221566fd2e983cf8f833c62e5; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 45e55e460864ac2c9639d7a673406fa64f6751a8; b98054f4a8582af49c77e53fcd9e68328ce7c01e; 61caaeca70d0261c482476a5f52abee5d15aec85; b8d527eea7a492d8673d1b551208f0b0b6198182; 5214b65ed56efffd97493a59114a772dfb54caf1; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; e3bd6e93288c00b45cb0b6fc1723cfa3f15161db; a966783349c09ff532cd31b14a3a155c85f6c284; 6a10eaedec9d402fb8d8b8900994d0aa27c5e129; a5a6fb8aabe8a4721afa1870a207267ea3f93c15; 4f673fdf5055cf50e1ad529eba68c83e7451407a; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; 87b8a375f3b252a43867522ad085cd48d0f2bc3f; 473e84a4f00ae3e5a267f90b37829131b4b6d303; 3e1c7f27763c6400010d81074df87c0e2ccdf83f; bf799d20cd75fea6fed415c5f78a678b921d9958; d6db548319b39df8030d1854fa803234cac75bd6,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification,10,375-390
2c49a116baa1a6bf2281fff04fdd3ad24980c2dd,Two predictive precision medicine tools for hepatocellular carcinoma,"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious threat to public health due to its poor prognosis. The current study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival of HCC patients.MethodsThe model cohort consisted of 24,991 mRNA expression data points from 348 HCC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic mRNA biomarkers for the overall survival of HCC patients.ResultsUsing multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses, a prognostic nomogram (named Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram) was constructed based on the expression data of N4BP3, -ADRA2B, E2F8, MAPT, PZP, HOXD9, COL15A1, and -NDST3. The C-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.765 (95% CI 0.724â€“0.806) for the overall survival in the model cohort. The Harrellâ€™s concordance-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.715 (95% CI 0.658â€“0.772) in the validation cohort. The survival curves demonstrated that the HCC patients in the high risk group had a significantly poorer overall survival than the patients in the low risk group.ConclusionIn the current study, we have developed two convenient and efficient predictive precision medicine tools for hepatocellular carcinoma. These two predictive precision medicine tools are helpful for predicting the individual mortality risk probability and improving the personalized comprehensive treatments for HCC patients.

4bdc1e26e028ac204730dcbe24c15f7d0878be77,Reference point insensitive molecular data analysis,"MOTIVATION
In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed.


RESULTS
Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.

There are some methods to solve the problem and each method has its own complexity. This research aims to explore performance of OLS, LASSO and PLS on data that have correlation between predictor variables. OLS establishes model by minimizing sum square of residual. LASSO minimizes sum square of residual subject to sum of absolute coefficient less than a constant and PLS combine principal component analysis and multiple linear regression. By analyzing simulation and real data using R program, results of this research are that for data with serious multicollinearity (there are high correlations between predictor variables), LASSO tend to have lower bias average than PLS in prediction of response variable.

d559885bff779f1aa1ace5cab441d91c93f1dc81,CA9 transcriptional expression determines prognosis and tumour grade in tongue squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"CA9 is a member of the carbonic anhydrases' family, that is often expressed in cancer cells under hypoxic condition. However, the role of CA9 in the molecular mechanisms of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) pathogenesis remains unclear. CA9 expression was analysed using the TCGA database, and its influence on survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier, LASSO and COX regression analyses. The correlation between CA9 and immune infiltration was investigated by CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE. Moreover, the relationship between CA9 expression and downstream molecular regulation pathways was analysed by GSEA, GO and WGCNA. CA9 expression correlated with clinical prognosis and tumour grade in TSCC. Moreover, CA9 expression potentially contributes to the regulation of cancer cell differentiation and mediates tumour-associated genes and signalling pathways, including apoptosis, hypoxia, G2M checkpoint, PI3K/AKR/mTOR signalling and TGF-beta signalling pathways. However, the follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells, immune and stromal scores showed no significance between high and low CA9 expression groups. These findings suggested that CA9 plays a critical role of TSCC prognosis and tumour grade. CA9 expression significantly correlated with the regulation of cell differentiation, various oncogenes and cancer-associated pathways.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chenyu Guan"", ids = ""27046675""); list(name = ""Dai-qiao Ouyang"", ids = ""8876516""); list(name = ""Yongjie Qiao"", ids = ""13540375""); list(name = ""Kan Li"", ids = ""49243432""); list(name = ""Guangsen Zheng"", ids = ""15736080""); list(name = ""Xiaomei Lao"", ids = ""7954069""); list(name = ""Sien Zhang"", ids = ""7670971""); list(name = ""Guiqing Liao"", ids = ""3106234""); list(name = ""Yujie Liang"", ids = ""50014794"")",,,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,,
4212cecf2ff70827205d6177e5b8b4d3c2616282,Change-Point Estimation in High Dimensional Regression Models,"We consider high dimensional nonhomogeneous linear regression models with p n 9 0 or p >> n, where p is the number of features and n is the number of observations. In the model considered, the underlying true regression coefficients undergo multiple changes. Our goal is to estimate the number and locations of these change-points and estimate sparse coefficients in each of the intervals between changepoints. This paper develops an approach to solve multiple change-points estimation problem in high dimensional linear regression model based on sparse group Lasso (SGL). We analyze the performance of our approach and prove several consistency results. In particular, under certain assumptions and using a properly chosen regularization parameter, we show that the estimation errors of linear coefficients and change-point locations can be expressed as functions of n, p and s, where s is the sparse level of each coefficient. From these functions, we can understand how the estimation errors scale with system parameters and identify conditions on system parameters under which the estimation errors diminish. Furthermore, we show that the estimation of change-points is always overfitting, which eliminates the risk of missing true change-points, and the isolated estimated change-points between true change-points does not occur, which implies that the estimated change-points are clustered around the true change points. We further extend our studies to general linear models (GLM) and prove similar results.

HIV-1 genetic sequences can be used to infer viral transmission history and dynamics. Throughout the United States, HIV-1 sequences from drug resistance testing are reported to local public health departments.


Methods
We investigated whether inferred HIV transmission network dynamics can identify individuals and clusters of individuals most likely to give rise to future HIV cases in a surveillance setting. We used HIV-TRACE, a genetic distance-based clustering tool, to infer molecular transmission clusters from HIV-1 pro/RT sequences from 65736 people in the New York City surveillance registry. Logistic and LASSO regression analyses were used to identify correlates of clustering and cluster growth, respectively. We performed retrospective transmission network analyses to evaluate individual- and cluster-level prioritization schemes for identifying parts of the network most likely to give rise to new cases in the subsequent year.


Results
Individual-level prioritization schemes predicted network growth better than random targeting. Across the 3600 inferred molecular transmission clusters, previous growth dynamics were superior predictors of future transmission cluster growth compared to individual-level prediction schemes. Cluster-level prioritization schemes considering previous cluster growth relative to cluster size further improved network growth predictions.

The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a nomogram for preoperative prediction of the malignant potential in patients with GIST. A total of 440 patients with pathologically confirmed GIST after surgery in our hospital from January 2011 to July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. They were randomly divided into the training set (nâ€‰=â€‰308) and validation set (nâ€‰=â€‰132). CT signs and texture features of each patient were analyzed and predictive model were developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression. Then a nomogram based on selected parameters was developed. The predictive effectiveness of nomogram was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots were formulated to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the nomogram by bootstrapping based on internal (training set) and external (validation set) validity. The clinical application value of the nomogram was determined through the decision curve analysis (DCA). Totally 156 GIST patients with low-malignant (very low and low risk) and 284 ones with high-malignant potential (intermediate and high risk) are enrolled in this study. The prediction nomogram consisting of size, cystoid variation and meanValue had an excellent discrimination both in training and validation sets (AUCs (95% confidence interval(CI)): 0.935 (0.908, 0.961), 0.933 (0.892, 0.974); C-indices (95% CI): 0.941 (0.912, 0.956), 0.935 (0.901, 0.982); sensitivity: 81.4, 90.6%; specificity: 75.0, 75.7%; accuracy: 88.0, 88.6%, respectively). The calibration curves indicated a good consistency between the actual observation and nomogram prediction for differentiating GIST malignancy. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. This study presents a prediction nomogram that incorporates the CT signs and texture parameter, which can be conveniently used to facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of malignancy in GIST patients.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Caiyue Ren"", ids = ""96820467""); list(name = ""Shengping Wang"", ids = ""49183916""); list(name = ""Shengjian Zhang"", ids = ""6172007"")",73a62b08dae9e383160fcc9ffcb61530a1aec3f8,b36a40e4a1152a226b166aa77bfbf7034b09902c; e4152831060f0ec60abc4facfea151bd5d1f4869; ad50ee1ce170bb2aba3c05b31a44e821bb36baa5; ed7e76e9397366ab8aec2780bb16fd48a58fdd8b; 2a085ba25aae4f85a521ee2adffac9f9450e17f6; 1b987aafea955d99a84772fd849ef1b13e275cd7; 42295f09b2e5dc5d0aa92564e66e369d667c76c7; 58495f2bca60e7783b8371cfd2c286b018173447; acf5569f7de9b6b72ba7e48e93dc8784394d94e9; 11d9dae9b75c45f344dca26ca5792c75f6fd1f1f; 95d130bc1a41235b6cd9463bc48bec0fa0493e14; bb8f97a2a5c77b166c10bf44191c79545fd51966; 8709ead4abfaf20dfce5cca9c302a80c13e7b778; 847b5e6796f19c0e98a91906dae679e80daf624b; 9971ff92d9d09b4736228bdbd7726e2e19b9aa2d; 484517d1147992b03cf81bdffcf1d443ed326d85; 64b0799aba5b819427ebaabe6ea27b0476122fe5; db94689a4b14061cd225a0b67ef2b24cb6c6a240; 9d211322dc670f97028114bc0cd6d3eb70f0440d; 1a768c7840a670dde9f0c51edafcb2c38d2400c0; 4815675cc80516d2bb3a8836f9f16acb4f301f55; 9e9a8d0f2dbe4c1aa7c6ac00a7bf5c1c91c249fb; 3bbe59dfd75d2a80a5d0ede5ea4c3e44cbef6efc; 8a7eff0f7831a6e4d2f98fbd61392b3ae684aefe; 751d01dc4b5fbde6a0c583e59b9ed88f1c092abc; c67c1116f1abb86df8b315b1c7fb6b849a446ce4; 7a6e909868752d91dd7bb4bf3d19f80609275461; 8ab5f7ae1e4d58c5797d2f169507444effb90c3d; 321e4f6b60803387f86c005122d25e0fe5b4b8a9; 4dc991d685ff557fa43d78739ddcf91dcc2eea16; 9c5c3ca850fab74e26044b7a4aacc9fcb037d0c1; f77f2796a382042c98f0eb509203c81e1dda3036; b393e63bf733dd36e1dddde24dafb8128115bf18; 3b08f7fd1526251e6daab80a45597659c9f692a0; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 3fb3e858ee47c77c1248316b938494740554816d,Cancer Imaging,20,

We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA), and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject. This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to 400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Wu"", ids = ""52229184""); list(name = ""Benjamin R.

a35ec1830025da231863da9bffa2d9d769413264,Support Union Recovery in High-dimensional Multivariate Regression,"multivariate group Lasso, in which block regularization based on the â€˜1/â€˜2 norm is used for support union recovery, or recovery of the set of s rows for which B is non-zero. Under high-dimensional scaling, we show that the multivariate group Lasso exhibits a threshold for the recovery of the exact row pattern with high probability over the random design and noise that is specified by the sample complexity parameter (n,p,s) := n/[2 (B )log(p s)]. Here n is the sample size, and (B ) is a sparsity-overlap function measuring a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coecient vectors that constitute the model. We prove that the multivariate group Lasso succeeds for problem sequences (n,p,s) such that (n,p,s) exceeds a critical level u, and fails for sequences such that (n,p,s) lies below a critical level â€˜. For the special case of the standard Gaussian ensemble, we show that â€˜ = u so that the characterization is sharp. The sparsity-overlap function (B ) reveals that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, â€˜1/â€˜2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to an ordinary Lasso approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to outperform the multivariate group Lasso.

64d87743a196893f0d764e0a41aecb0b8dd4af46,Predicting gene expression using DNA methylation in three human populations,"Background
DNA methylation, an important epigenetic mark, is well known for its regulatory role in gene expression, especially the negative correlation in the promoter region. However, its correlation with gene expression across genome at human population level has not been well studied. In particular, it is unclear if genome-wide DNA methylation profile of an individual can predict her/his gene expression profile. Previous studies were mostly limited to association analyses between single CpG site methylation and gene expression. It is not known whether DNA methylation of a gene has enough prediction power to serve as a surrogate for gene expression in existing human study cohorts with DNA samples other than RNA samples.


Results
We examined DNA methylation in the gene region for predicting gene expression across individuals in non-cancer tissues of three human population datasets, adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource Projects (MuTHER), peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from Asthma and normal control study participates, and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from healthy individuals. Three prediction models were investigated, single linear regression, multiple linear regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression. Our results showed that LASSO regression has superior performance among these methods. However, the prediction power is generally low and varies across datasets. Only 30 and 42 genes were found to have cross-validation R2 greater than 0.3 in the PBMC and Adipose datasets, respectively. A substantially larger number of genes (258) were identified in the LCL dataset, which was generated from a more homogeneous cell line sample source. We also demonstrated that it gives better prediction power not to exclude any CpG probe due to cross hybridization or SNP effect.


Conclusion
In our three population analyses DNA methylation of CpG sites at gene region have limited prediction power for gene expression across individuals with linear regression models. The prediction power potentially varies depending on tissue, cell type, and data sources. In our analyses, the combination of LASSO regression and all probes not excluding any probe on the methylation array provides the best prediction for gene expression.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Huan Zhong"", ids = ""38868202""); list(name = ""Soyeon Kim"", ids = ""46876661""); list(name = ""Degui Zhi"", ids = ""2842889""); list(name = ""Xiangqin Cui"", ids = ""1763386"")",,73250cae7de207cbf8d9de08acebd0fde73b3264; 1473110f6c33b483251ade10b79416d3efee2da4; 2113346aadcb985cd7bc5866d7e3935f6a0a4782; d42ee8c4432d1a595dbebed6366f6dd95adf4158; 036e4b339317a194f14109023bd7bf65600a40d9; 3682a3f6efbea22915268254815034f7987322d5; 25b22065b0c55821d909fcf0af1a74fb84bb40c6; 2514c0a02a293e0d2953a2e56e34a553dab03476; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 49efa0bd104c853a51c51b766e7b4958c66fa058; 87056405a26fe76526a21280d53698bf2195ffd9; 97fab90fb28462efa0eb4218b4d58a045b147c05; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 3a3c84abbe8a9bf9a4602616a0d860b12fe9cc46; bf9503ffbdae1847a62b4ffc839f1a5ebb2a3aee; fb156076888c08cc57c4796009a8e5567a29ea88; 1c1e53dabd2af511e9b9d424ed21c7cebbf2eca7; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 406f2845ee8de02ac8b72069e8a6fe1376c88278; 4611aa2c72a5082ba3c9f8a39b5c158753512542; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; 3dbd5c5d8dec77aea43c045fcf47486fafce640c; bc4bcdd08d5f20848213c6a6569129d7f745a6af; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 99a032baa3c4e9e5085684bd849c2888161c70ee,PeerJ,7,
3c81a003f5f146445513ed20b421e91a57f68809,Novel radiomic signature as a prognostic biomarker for locally advanced rectal cancer,"BACKGROUND
Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patient stratification by clinicoradiologic factors may yield variable results. Therefore, more efficient prognostic biomarkers are needed for improved risk stratification of LARC patients, personalized treatment, and prognostication.


PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS
To compare the ability of a radiomic signature to predict disease-free survival (DFS) with that of a clinicoradiologic risk model in individual patients with LARC.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective study.


POPULATION
In all, 108 consecutive patients (allocated to a training and validation set with a 1:1 ratio) with LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Axial 3D LAVA multienhanced MR sequence at 3T.


ASSESSMENT
ITK-SNAP software was used for manual segmentation of 3D pre-nCRT MR images. All manual tumor segmentations were performed by a gastrointestinal tract radiologist, and validated by a senior radiologist. The clinicoradiologic risk factors with potential prognostic outcomes were identified in univariate analysis based on the Cox regression model for the whole set. The results showed that ypT, ypN, EMVI, and MRF were potential clinicoradiologic risk factors. Interestingly, only ypN and MRF were identified as independent predictors in multivariate analysis based on the Cox regression model.


STATISTICAL TESTS
A radiomic signature based on 485 3D features was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. The association of the radiomic signature with DFS was investigated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Three models were built and assessed for their predictive values, using the Harrell concordance index and integrated time-dependent area under the curve.


RESULTS
The novel radiomic signature stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups for DFS in the training set (hazard ratio [HR]â€‰=â€‰6.83; P < 0.001), and was successfully validated in the validation set (HRâ€‰=â€‰2.92; P < 0.001). The model combining the radiomic signature and clinicoradiologic findings had the best performance (C indexâ€‰=â€‰0.788, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.86; integrated time-dependent area under the curve of 0.837 at 3 years).


DATA CONCLUSION
The novel radiomic signature could be used to predict DFS in patients with LARC. Furthermore, combining this radiomic signature with clinicoradiologic features significantly improved the ability to estimate DFS (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, 0.005 in training set and in validation set, respectively), and may help guide individualized treatment in such patients.

0f8475eddfaa4876ed6364cbd27df6f174c915a4,Forecasting Electricity Spot Prices Using Lasso: On Capturing the Autoregressive Intraday Structure,"In this paper we present a regression based model for day-ahead electricity spot prices. We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday dependency structure of the electricity price well. We discuss in detail the estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of electricity prices. We perform an out-of-sample forecasting study for several European electricity markets. The results illustrate well that the efficient lasso based estimation technique can exhibit advantages from two popular model approaches.",2016,Economics,"list(name = ""Florian Ziel"", ids = ""40030503"")",93daf986dd1202f2874f8054ba7585ebfdd62543; 6f1ac89c79ab6dd52fd3cfcb7887ac8ddccc741e; 3405aee7bd1c9551638139e62e1f11b36873bdc1; a7d026a59505b81149c26002d0ee7030eb0e2004; a10eb70b72eaf88ec716a93a2ead097a20201496; 108808435baa5c790979c4f179918203245ae949; afa233661c12be57d1a72505ad5c841a6d2cc4ff; e9a70a972c7b4d9f5355fe0ed2a89bad0b075cd7; 5bbf1227136d7753c88bfc319463b37568bfd766; 20e5d053b2d694ebb351ae9ca565952f65e94796; a4c73d9ab33c5668b5d2d69d11bcfd8dceb82f6f; d4a6fb38c65eee9c6c1bbf6b1cf4a582b64773c8; 4388011e8731257448078f3f54dc0445d92b727c; e9dbcf2d5b69fd3154399b4f15157dbf882e83ef; 731bedc2ef4a54bdf5ef9413f591d122ee7457d1; d42bda83e2a7fae6a65272513510b0e255fcc0ac; 354fadb98da9b509c4399ef42a484d278079aadd; 9a3143946035e6a26c560b85a1da28ee10c05b1e; d4a4791205cd6cfcdaf0c4d7f16f46ba62c70f66; 251be7f2522a60448346d46809f59b7cd99a40c6; 877aa26674aaf0a39ae34710be23e40291d5f111; d70978cd41cedbba984db02e2d37e01d2fc14645; 61b55b5be5fd2e5411dea19dedfe2906464c148b; a23652776ea1550a244c26efcf73cfa9f566cc81; 18be232d13269f4e6c0a630819730420bbbf22f9; 89c34e6fbfc06a7f8ef3895d367c6ea51bf26552; 58fb84b716779649349531f83864b9562298239d; 0ffeb98541e5dc42fb3aeede1bdb6b53911e5a85; 58b2f85436c89a1ebab010e0d3007fa8099cb671; c423b2494cb46da83fbebdf94ecc07fa80c4ca11; a8aa32cb99f8eb3beb56b59b13449fd82dcd1d6d; 8cf5c9055688e8105febb4647bb7d7b87b7c2e25; ac26556a7079a82cd0e7262c691dcec15539005e; 65c65801f410065c56f7fc1e2ad025ca5212a259; 34a148395f7ca79ecb45066d3a2847376d411748; c5b2d973381aeb74605f3c5678eaf2dec1b050e6; 1da2063a2839c81cbea597b622297c891fa9e574,a831f9457e033fbcbad18ba7ac3575d01fe3d159; d9ed62c00caaade2a6947989e09f94adee69ec32; 1f3e5d8612f9e272163677d5d763979fa84ed87b; 723e0c1e8c128af435e8e21bdb823dc2d381be6e; ee2bb05547c09b976bc4cc722442b4a07131b57c; 1c858f62945df1a0c20c3dee2f12e77bdf222812; ec2ee29e3c7d01224058ca7fcc7bd7d5ce63f9bc; d5a60c8f7e8dec2079aabf088e28e9aa3127932d; 1e41e0bc749c881f32458b644233b71d2ae8593c; f91d7c29301fb167359f2a8380f8af58d6c1c7f3; 74a62a3fa105041420eb7e522571ee3ed8affe86; 00b7f44857676600805172e99be6f9f2987e98eb; 1b79a60adf5f4bdf40a21994b2e5477657c8bdbe; 29d1944867766a143d44d7e95441ee3aff464e8d; e361a85d07ba483b07935f53017a152ef3d36205; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; e91eec5c945d0fc669eab7c58668193eaad39302; ec24ee4fadded81988587fbd4fce1e2d4591ad12; cda259fc322c85577d336fd4271737feee26e222; af692bd5336621b5c107975ade83740cdea091e1; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 3d6b9f7112e8460662268a746783f5aaca6591c6; b53a5f6ea4980a3683ac41673ba895e6e3f86b0e; 17398389260c687f81b69df8ec23c9102e2c25a2; 8038017306c4ad88d40d338f96906deaf8ce71c2; a699a2d0f8295682fc09441dee716f83f442feb4; d4e8a9d3b15685a7f4cfb6621831cf7f563cefd5; caf470b66b57a91925ef949a9d571ada76d7ef81; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; bf51c41ef161669e5c5bbb109c6ea4455377d7ad,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,31,4977-4987
