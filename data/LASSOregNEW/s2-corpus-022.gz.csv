53c8e6ccbdfa380351df10d801300f53706d8772,A machine learning approach for predictive models of adverse events following spine surgery.,"BACKGROUND
Rates of adverse events following spine surgery vary widely by patient-, diagnosis-, and procedure-related factors. It is critical to understand the expected rates of complications and to be able to implement targeted efforts at limiting these events.


PURPOSE
To develop and evaluate a set of predictive models for common adverse events after spine surgery.


STUDY DESIGN
A retrospective cohort study PATIENT SAMPLES: We extracted 345,510 patients from the Truven MarketScan (MKS) and MarketScan Medicaid Databases and 760,724 patients from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare database who underwent spine surgeries between 2009 and 2013.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Overall adverse event (AE) occurrence and types of AE occurrence during the 30-day post-operative follow-up.


METHODS
We applied a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization method and a logistic regression approach for predicting the risks of an overall AE and the top six most commonly observed AEs. Predictors included patient demographics, location of the spine procedure, comorbidities, type of surgery performed, and pre-operative diagnosis.


RESULTS
The median ages of MKS and CMS patients were 49 years and 69, respectively. The most frequent individual AE was a cardiac dysfunction in CMS (10.6%) patients and a pulmonary complication (4.7%) in MKS. The AUC of a prediction model for an overall AE was 0.7. Among the six individual prediction models, the model for predicting the risk of a pulmonary complication showed the greatest accuracy (AUC 0.76), and the range of AUC for these six models was 0.7 and 0.76. Medicaid status was one of the most important factors in predicting the occurrences of AEs; Medicaid recipients had increased odds of AEs by 20-60% compared to non-Medicaid patients (odds ratios: 1.28-1.6; P<10-10). Logistic regression showed higher AUCs than LASSO across these different models.


CONCLUSIONS
We present a set of predictive models for AEs following spine surgery that account for patient-, diagnosis-, and procedure-related factors which can contribute to patient-counseling, accurate risk adjustment, and accurate quality metrics.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Summer S Han"", ids = ""3885102""); list(name = ""Tej D Azad"", ids = ""3467197""); list(name = ""Paola Andrea NiÃ±o SuÃ¡rez"", ids = ""143931040""); list(name = ""John Kevin Ratliff"", ids = ""2951785"")",cbd6e408b1b4d91b5fd592e7aca1032f853005ff; a295fbb88b1f1486cb6b115b0e2a406523aa0406; cc428a1f7cf4f9aaf655ff958d1b5dc756760bf1; 568aae2eef7a6b6ed0104e14d00e72491a265a4c,,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,,
fa68855527fff9e6b9001e11c04c76aee01e4eb6,Regularized Multinomial Regression Method for Hyperspectral Data Classification via Pathwise Coordinate Optimization,"Hyperspectral imagery generally contains enormous amounts of data due to hundreds of spectral bands. As recent researchers have discovered, many of the bands are highly correlated and may provide redundant information for the classification related problems. Therefore, feature selection is very important in hyperspectral image processing problem. ''Pathwise Coordinate Descent'' algorithm is the ''one-at-a-time'' coordinate-wise descent algorithm for a class of convex optimization problems. When applied on the L1-regularized regression (lasso) problem, the algorithm can handle large problems and can also efficiently obtain sparse features in a comparatively very low timing cost. Through computing the solutions for a decreasing sequence of regularization parameters, the algorithm also combines model selection procedure into itself. In this paper, we utilize the multinomial logistic regression with lasso, elastic-net convex penalties on hyperspectral image classification. Pathwise Coordinate Descent is used for estimation these models. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the context of the hyperspectral data classification problem, models obtained by Pathwise Coordinate Descent algorithm do effectively achieve a sparse feature subsets and very good classification results with very low computational costs.",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jiming Li"", ids = ""34123477""); list(name = ""Yuntao Qian"", ids = ""40503368"")",9bbf7db43ef49f3d37a9ba41fd5a0206d67a7110; 6e5015772797b886b7d1ed8686feeb33f9769feb; d40b6b68b0e9f43b1287de8723e8021ee0c97072; cca88c5f948151329fc2e33cf45d1d0f11037f94; b2203cdf5655e60906b501565b0414372d1127fb; 1301138fd1df0e08c994f9eb6fe41b75fe8b7f06; caaefab9f7956822b8a14c041331addb2725e7d8,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 5d9eb3450441269f33c7efd7c74a266bb75c1736; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; d64f6da18f559e0af3c7dc914296660cd1c801b7; c94dec3fc99c4a653afb935d00246f788689c341; 5b284ad0479a4ed16929c43f0e8f1a4bb3a06fd9; 59527e01260aeae345713d0e2eb29b3031fb020f; c73d2b5b612214dfad41fb0ea117663c8eb6ed0f; 3e3ec72e932d7205a541e67e0f9a1fde5235eefd; 6434a32dfa090fd5e5ae3809958dd68bacb5839c; 346bf03a2457c7ade1bd27678a4e03d75da01af6; 5355e8c7359b8dadb970099dcd6fa951fa5ef3b7; cdb903803efdd2dbd93cd3cc29eab632a2ca66dd; fa9ded3ceab32b6fcb88137807924283078daf61,2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications,,540-545
e328898813fa2c08c0b4e465e9cc44b8ed1ccb90,A Two-Stage Method to Identify Joint Modules From Matched MicroRNA and mRNA Expression Data,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs, which play key roles in gene regulation. Previous studies have revealed that they are likely to work together to regulate their common target genes. Discovery of the underlying combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes can provide useful information for understanding their functions as well as their close relevance to cancer. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for identifying miRNA-gene regulatory modules by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and miRNA genomic cluster data. We first develop a multiple-output sparse group lasso (MSGL) regression model to predict a miRNA-gene association matrix (i.e., a miRNA-gene regulatory network). Further, we propose a L0-regularized singular value decomposition (L0-SVD) to identify miRNA-gene joint modules from the predicted regulatory network. We test our method on the matched miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in breast cancer from TCGA project and identify ten miRNA-gene regulatory modules. We find that 1) the modules are significantly associated in the predicted miRNA-gene regulatory network; 2) the modules are significantly enriched in GO biological processes and KEGG pathways, respectively; 3) many miRNAs and genes in the modules are related with breast cancer. On average, 51% of the miRNAs and 30% of the genes are related with breast cancer. The results demonstrate that miRNA-gene regulatory modules provide insights into the mechanisms of the combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Wenwen Min"", ids = ""33678563""); list(name = ""Juan Liu"", ids = ""37427978""); list(name = ""Fei Luo"", ids = ""1808151""); list(name = ""Shihua Zhang"", ids = ""39531510"")",3acad51dd1aa4ccb91e4b2956f1953d3ea8e94bf; f5c9dc6feba582075b2bff699e2f944e2bf5939e; 952e25054a2c7c109ec0921c73961eaca82eda03,083a32a442fe96a400a81c1c2868abfee7cf3592; 167836c4dc8502d026517111541966bfa19a918b; d86e2351a43c195ff6b4833d0452a6c552854133; 297c59104f0bb8652036f7a3eea5de93c5fb7fe8; 7a26e5e2090a6fafe5d8389a1d02075e6ff42a25; 4bb8e200b25db55f7014a46c6f2d71b471e49a4f; d743a52df7dee899de54c9056450ebb409f51a48; c1d5adbe76bb3b72c71ed930272dec2a3a917f76; 7953ea921cbd3c62cac3004dafcd630e31eae81d; 921d41df00daa062b7176a6a25436bfb742f109d; 77d4bf19c8e45bad15635ea6ccee6668b94647d8; 37d1cb7bd901bd001204ab4da6e14deb537e04a9; 6ca7ac1ecde20b48749bdfba3cbaa02339e3a454; eb0ee8737b1fe4d4e71fdfa9b584bbcdc9088db4; 7ddcfdb9293e565c3ece4302bcb030fab918cf47; 6eb20b15fc964069104aaeb4c68a71005d540fa3; 8a3c2cce1114455aef9eaeea42188100b1dfe75d; 89bc99c67ca16e84ee9b0071290d36ddc17eb2a1; 869bbbfc036aba11c6f68a6ee8585f5194326ef0; 3f3757499affd63e5eb65f49541f38043275a047; edea9b9172659571ce0724642abf665653afe473; ce2ff569d69942d81b7975a3a8104dd276428ce2; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 470ade321bb5112ffb4916448242488ec320d28d; 2a2e5cfffe3c6b569e3b3311b699b482e96fe0c6; 539c4d0de77c73ca146cec32058386ab420defd7; 739315dc1368d18d43ac09932659506f5c94300b; cc9b542e18972a3315f53eee40493e2feeb011f2; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; 8dc3858622e3348cdca9b99b39c4ef7e04150fca; 8705dc8973afb7c9cad5aeb860b66cde464fb33f; 240aa3fbe87b1fb085815baa87cca8bd04f52f70; d27919e0fa4978d96737a1e201c7a4f901b15bac; 72319e2cb0a2703557835aa193e874a5cee59ff2; 06d06e72895d8b887d21d9f704ba448ab8af1caa; 70935bbdac17728c273ed01a9951490de3958482; 16e36439d468036cbe7ad96340218231136646e0; b878582e29de24552424be2316d571f0c7db3fac; 533a03abd3467b18e6de4aa8e2efeb30b04f384d; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6,IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience,15,362-370

We created a dataset of 79 CT images containing liver lesions identified and annotated by a radiologist using a controlled vocabulary of 76 semantic terms. Computationally-derived features were extracted describing intensity, texture, shape, and edge sharpness. Traditional logistic regression was compared to L(1)-regularized logistic regression (LASSO) in order to predict the radiological observations using computational features. The approach was evaluated by leave one out cross-validation. Informative radiological observations such as lesion enhancement, hypervascular attenuation, and homogeneous retention were predicted well by computational features.

abb3269cbfef81a2201709dd010625e1fa60e435,A semi-mechanism approach based on MRI and proteomics for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As current treatments may be effective only at the early stages of AD, it is important to track MCI patients who will convert to AD. The aim of this study is to develop a high performance semi-mechanism based approach to predict the conversion from MCI to AD and improve our understanding of MCI-to-AD conversion mechanism. First, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and lasso regression are employed to identify the markers related to the conversion. Then the Bayesian network based on selected markers is established to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. The structure of Bayesian network suggests that the conversion may start with fibrin clot formation, verbal memory impairment, eating pattern changing and hyperinsulinemia. The Bayesian network achieves a high 10-fold cross-validated prediction performance with 96% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 65% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

751f5e033c9b3fdc92527d8a2751fbdda7e79a09,"Laboratory Biomarkers, Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity, and Intellectual Function in Children with Sickle Cell Disease","Objective
The aim of this preliminary study was to describe putative markers of cerebral vasculopathy and investigate relationships among these markers, demographic factors, and cognitive function in a young sample of neurologically normal children with SCD. Study Design. Thirty-eight children with homozygous HbS, aged 4-11 years, were included. Estimated IQ and markers of coagulation and endothelial activation, hemolysis, and inflammation, as well as transcranial Doppler velocities, hydroxyurea use, and demographic information were obtained.


Results
Using multiple regression analyses, there were few significant independent associations between biomarkers or blood flow velocity and estimated IQ. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) independently predicted cognitive function, but blood flow velocity did not mediate this relationship. Maternal education, patient age, and hydroxyurea status were independent predictors of cognition. Given the small sample size, a LASSO statistical model was employed to further identify potential predictors of IQ, which identified LDH, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), tissue factor (TF), maternal education, age, and hydroxyurea as potential predictors of cognition.


Conclusions
In addition to effects of age and maternal education, some vasculopathic markers are associated with cognitive function in young children with SCD, and these relationships do not appear to be mediated through blood flow velocity. Although the lack of association among certain variables was not as predicted, results provide support for further research regarding the influence of vasculopathic markers on cognitive function in children with SCD without stroke, especially intravascular hemolysis and coagulation/endothelial activation, and a possible role for HU treatment in preventing or reversing cognitive decline.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nataly Apollonsky"", ids = ""12558213""); list(name = ""Norma B.

fdbcbb3edfa7d5fee24f85391b75fe19015afefd,Adaptive Elastic Net GMM Estimation with Many Invalid Moment Conditions: Simultaneous Model and Moment Selection,"This paper develops the adaptive elastic net GMM estimator in large dimensional models with many possibly invalid moment conditions, where both the number of structural parameters and the number of moment conditions may increase with the sample size. The basic idea is to conduct the standard GMM estimation combined with two penalty terms: the quadratic regularization and the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage. The new estimation procedure consistently selects both the nonzero structural parameters and the valid moment conditions. At the same time, it uses information only from the valid moment conditions to estimate the selected structural parameters and thus achieves the standard GMM efficiency bound as if we know the valid moment conditions ex ante. It is shown that the quadratic regularization is important to obtain the efficient estimator. We also study the tuning parameter choice, with which we show that selection consistency still holds without assuming Gaussianity. We apply the new estimation procedure to dynamic panel data models, where both the time and cross section dimensions are large. The new estimator is robust to possible serial correlations in the regression error terms.

6490e9c5467dbaa6513f0fcd1947d7df6549b245,Markers of Neuroinflammation Associated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Pathology in Older Adults,"BACKGROUND: In vitro and animal studies have linked neuroinflammation to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathology. Studies on markers of inflammation in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia provided inconsistent results. We hypothesized that distinct blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers are associated with biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in older adults without cognitive impairment or with beginning cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To identify blood-based and CSF neuroinflammation marker signatures associated with AD pathology (i.e. an AD CSF biomarker profile) and to investigate associations of inflammation markers with CSF biomarkers of amyloid, tau pathology, and neuronal injury. DESIGN/METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on data from 120 older community-dwelling adults with normal cognition (n = 48) or with cognitive impairment (n = 72). CSF AÎ²1-42, tau and p-tau181, and a panel of 37 neuroinflammatory markers in both CSF and serum were quantified. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to determine a reference model that best predicts an AD CSF biomarker profile defined a priori as p-tau181/AÎ²1-42 ratio >0.0779. It was then compared to a second model that included the inflammatory markers from either serum or CSF. In addition, the correlations between inflammatory markers and CSF AÎ²1-42, tau and p-tau181 levels were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-two subjects met criteria for having an AD CSF biomarker profile. The best predictive models included 8 serum or 3 CSF neuroinflammatory markers related to cytokine mediated inflammation, vascular injury, and angiogenesis. Both models improved the accuracy to predict an AD biomarker profile when compared to the reference model. In analyses separately performed in the subgroup of participants with cognitive impairment, adding the serum or the CSF neuroinflammation markers also improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD pathology. None of the inflammatory markers correlated with the CSF AÎ²1-42 levels. Six CSF markers (IL-15, MCP-1, VEGFR-1, sICAM1, sVCAM-1, and VEGF-D) correlated with the CSF tau and p-tau181 levels, and these associations remained significant after controlling for age, sex, cognitive impairment, and APOEÎµ4 status. CONCLUSIONS: The identified serum and CSF neuroinflammation biomarker signatures improve the accuracy of classification for AD pathology in older adults. Our results suggest that inflammation, vascular injury, and angiogenesis as reflected by CSF markers are closely related to cerebral tau pathology.",2016,Psychology,"list(name = ""Julius Popp"", ids = ""4964886""); list(name = ""Michael Bacher"", ids = ""40111089""); list(name = ""DomilÄ— TautvydaitÄ—"", ids = ""8792513""); list(name = ""Loic Dayon"", ids = ""52159900""); list(name = ""Gene L Bowman"", ids = ""35078283"")",,9b19b655eaad033877f715ca1a4eddd6cf881903; 4718e61de2c928d77780b2a72fac704f18d8297b; 81a3a1d1f096a36e2634e7fb5b3a9b244ae5b0aa; 522457e6050bc863eebbbe22285fa1430bd0edd6; df4da7b9a6a7ed9c1ef03a9f509a600401f6a30e; 42103a69b0a399418fd7cdc56ab2382960bd1b20; 384c074ec0a86866085a86b0c8dfbf4791342a12; 6bfd30a483a4073623c901943128aa5bdf5e5dcd; 4586e7676207b65f4e7933be863dec2a924872b8; 41714e6011c1431dfa51e28ce3beca5c3e8b3793; 45bb07d61acdaafd9b946a43d782470688608a05; 977d6128653b30f4f2b925b8b5ef1ae854793937; a661ddd88dcbe108b191d815773d5eddd93f4da1; d1484a71db1065d9b44938b09b91ab5d3ff99928; 9f8172276af291242253acfee88cdc9df7655702; 4ea01cd619c0fd2764ecaffe58d1059dbd54ee8b; e5b498c498de9328613bd260b0d891f72f8f54fa; fd55cb28e40788680e3dfae6b7dee1852a73a4c2; 4f23c6e115f3ca2f6edac3a916d0c7c138e34fa9; e3da909bbc90853ab28c6b535f6538a3c2f54446; ae3c3d13d0d8514b0cdcaccd1718b6c6227b8639; d116d0bbb5f4af7c025cffc05966b22fdb83ec43; bac2f6d2042aa5584939c7f3bc167d1d42af8853; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 302e179b7d0555cf21665cd41ae830ebcb1bdd64; 335685cb999e42d038ee929a198175e1d125edc5; 1a2a899da8956cf9e6597c3b841043837ac7c93b; 8ddac82b1cbb7faf90ac3703e28cc94da209f3ce; eed30ec6c65deb69e8f403dd22949a85de2ec423; dd2c4bd78460d1c9e738623b9a7128703d5a5c08; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 441ccf68b90c35106e4835d8c04bb588d30fe957; 2f2e7f3aa0be8203d212f105c861ca167dc7b73e; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 6bc5100bb016f1a502c977d27aeb1468b443ca2f; cea1dd912a8ca225c9367e24b0e90c39c79ff8d9; df41859bfe841fa10b9a7b213322f7496780ae17; aa1efd363a98a2617844e33b100e86cb336f8507; 279f79a964b2d8e93dbf0bc81884dd9c9db5897a; 709e529febc56672b150c6eaae0eb4963ebde9ce; 72e417d6d1c7b2d687c7b81b4511b9ed804e98ba; 1cb6e8cda95d4ede92bde0ddf9f0b415c970fb83; 85ae89ad108bae948628d5307bcdb7fddbaf2826; f8bc048f1f83fcdbed972f0f9ebff8f90eeae8fb; ec2b6e7acf81d3154aeddeab03615beea073a3dc; 82920544f365b661b1f2e68abe91acd0c7d6f7f8; 98883f93e3b308f21a585413173c8582c7fe2a1c; 3f10c4f504a15a48af76b6a8be8f068cf272bd04; 4fa8886bfa6c3a8c6eaf72b32c063e6273ef9107; 7182dcff19abc799ea3803f2ecef21c1588c7304; da1984f622f9fa5c2436335dbf4bfb57ed925db7; 8e7df91833405816b1ae9a38525c16f8309b1fe0; 03b1b6709a7584412577ec1c89c9f891f5d0d2f7; c3c41e49f9ccf3ce9c02739b7c765b2979850784; 6f2225281cc6b19fa7d0ec6b93402ca0f72bc635; 2f346bbd34820285bd4cc11c05c13dda178dc465; 37d2d04f8c09da1f0cf8434a38a51841b5b703bf; ce908e88f74ab372dc80b0b92a459290d439e67f; fca574c768be3b19ae94a99678205c926de7cb75; cd9ccf982c82017b2a5e237b3a0f3332e2499e10,Alzheimer's & Dementia,12,
2d54a996abb84cd9dcdc8b8056f0881720d833ed,The Effect of Climate Variability on Main Components of Cow Milk in Iran,"The main purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between six bioclimatic indices for cattle (temperature humidity (THI), environmental stress (ESI), equivalent temperature (ESI), heat load (HLI), modified heat load (HLInew) and respiratory rate predictor(RRP)) and fundamental milk components (fat, protein, and milk yield) considering uncertainty. The climate parameters used to calculate the climate indices were taken from the NASA-Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA) reanalysis from 2002 to 2010. Cow milk data were considered for the same period from April to September when cows use natural pasture, with possibility for cows to choose to stay in the barn or to graze on the pasture in the pasturing system. The study is based on a linear regression analysis using correlations as a summarizing diagnostic. Bootstrapping is used to represent uncertainty estimation through resampling in the confidence intervals. To find the relationships between climate indices (THI, ETI, HLI, HLInew, ESI and RRP) and main components of cow milk (fat, protein and yield), multiple liner regression is applied. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) techniques are applied to select the best model for milk predictands with the smallest number of climate predictors. Cross validation is used to avoid over-fitting. Based on results of investigation the effect of heat stress indices on milk compounds separately, we suggest the use of ESI and RRP in the summer and ESI in the spring. THI and HLInew are suggested for fat content and HLInew also is suggested for protein content in the spring season. The best linear models are found in spring between milk yield as predictands and THI, ESI,HLI, ETI and RRP as predictors with p-value < 0.001 and R2 0.50, 0.49. In summer, milk yield with independent variables of THI, ETI and ESI show the highest relation (p-value < 0.001) with R2 (0.69). For fat and protein the results are only marginal. It is strongly suggested that new and significant indices are needed to control critical heat stress conditions that consider more predictors of the effect of climate variability on animal products, such as sunshine duration, quality of pasture, the number of days of stress (NDS), the color of skin with attention to large black spots, and categorical predictors such as breed, welfare facility, and management system. This methodology is suggested for studies investigating the impacts of climate variability/change on food quality/security, animal science and agriculture using short term data considering uncertainty or data collection is expensive, difficult, or data with gaps.",2016,Geography,"list(name = ""M Milani"", ids = ""122667725""); list(name = ""Mohammad Habib Reza"", ids = ""108393215"")",,b9666dfce48ea18ef9676297dcc6cb62a85fefde; c3c36571108857e844ce601b7980f46db257c2fd; 76e384d8a4c9c3e3640c29ff6cd4d54a0180ed23; aad9b29a831dd8599e34b4f9aedb66691f08c92c; 8da1f0fb7ede538f1d3cb59934c37aea33301774; a6dca914b0460db39186491531d783f23f55a8ab; 1a32d99f642e1e3c03173d8ac20ae231ce8a1f56; c7c644a8b94225e95cf726a7610f14a2835a28ed; 2b6384f1181567244a13433e7e55631cf4097838; e59198a72d5259dadc1a71afcba1e66bd68b3365; c751544bb0dba35160acdc31606448fecb0411b8; ddf999a97c3d8c3dfa6b17448d1afb0a4baf16e2; 074439515e65c9e2db8ef136daeaf4c8ee02c036; df45f6e2d2e3a4abac857b914cae703f225957a0; b2c3cbf647beb3cba96494ae6b0042fd110e411f; 7648a473e5118be58a92e05798a38b1cddfc18ef; 0b84a2b915799a4da248ed80ae3b046ef69b2dd0; f2b6dc77603f9e0bb8b4bee4bf5de6fde910472f; f1827e43def545f2f8a131dc4674df72736bcaaa; fec7bb84bd7086b5fc717d1ee1ab450e88e06c50; cf199e690ee90c8f4b030124d8a8d8d28931dc8c; 7f46e4893003f47e56f1761d4bb0d24b5edf7782; f91f997a356bd6207c3b55c9ffdaf77c4e25afbb; eeff35508a71c9c9507a2a6ef4c18100d73171b4; fbf9cabf26b006009eefecfbbb2d96cb1f8c8156; 3fd75071ad495f7e127ab509570bbf2dd3b36f2b; d7e9ec8c05243cd7017cebc609e4d16466b62afd; 45169ab57755e54750adb7cfecb99788a707016e; 10dc8bd5daf066cf408075bd233b67ae275d4c49; 623f3b5c468aff0f3fae7e46eb9d2c942bbb129b; b9ed2f6a170f2184520572addbc1894f0e8ea312; c381a4c2acdbf294ef93a81d61d6fd97d48b506c; de6f1e9f40fbc23228f7ef1d211e610d6810ef4f; 8235302e8e89be35f6f3bcbb8e32c200fb7432a8; 57f4c47992009a92976f29936d45ef4e1c832fcb; 08ee710b82ad9826454c7b3978ac267f79ac7657; 5a343015d755a9001a26287b7a92028b5d026617; 5bd940697300ce0b682cfbad06f436c5ee997c4c; 01417b7251442f6336b448774c8a51d2bc3aa269; dc7df9e4834794ca7c13ff4d6f0eca7616714c5d; 43311a87b071e7a2c66e8b95a4f42aba42a85100; 28204bef468bdfd1646e6bd7ba8c5358fa66ca90; ad6b611a327072e5da32985717570e9260cd0a27; cf03967b07cc79af9450f748b57bbc3267cdca25; 41fd1f8f9fee217be28a078d4546ee7e2046abd1; 6e4fd355f26fd05026240299aa919d92e5a72856; ff6ab40df160a3bde485217a1b812c8284fea2bb; 9720f86a390c41b5fcf89fa89f5fcfd88ed609e2; 4ae14912ece1453aa282e04d3486bfdd34996f4d; 6f62ddb2efacdb288eda6c83a4ed45d90e1f3606; f469d8b17c23b1f0c279d05441a49e5a4570e782; 9f6dcc23c84d7153dac486e7e0cff18f2ee663dc; 6a3d6e9adf87d4b71335577bb38e603c58c41ece; a779658bc3a5839a9ecf913ca0b1e173c1b2a3a0; 82825ea3ddad89e8e5ae3291bf30515d0ddd3315; 1e0aed8ce4f3b5a3eb5b73156e7f08d5f90060f9; 6e98a72a487912fcd0d2894766ca33c97b8f3c05; da7b6ce54a96a6a96393b2d458e8f51e7d26a209,,,
1d8ff0b4952badcbbf6619caf4c9b83fc6994f9c,Advances in variable selection and visualization methods for analysis of multivariate data,"This thesis concerns the analysis of multivariate data. The amount of data that is obtained from various sources and stored in digital media is growing at an exponential rate. The data sets tend to be too large in terms of the number of variables and the number of observations to be analyzed by hand. In order to facilitate the task, the data set must be summarized somehow. This work introduces machine learning methods that are capable of finding interesting patterns automatically from the data. The findings can be further used in decision making and prediction. The results of this thesis can be divided into three groups. The first group of results is related to the problem of selecting a subset of input variables in order to build an accurate predictive model for several response variables simultaneously. Variable selection is a difficult combinatorial problem in essence, but the relaxations examined in this work transform it into a more tractable optimization problem of continuous-valued parameters. The main contribution here is extending several methods that are originally designed for a single response variable to be applicable with multiple response variables as well. Examples of such methods include the well known lasso estimate and the least angle regression algorithm. The second group of results concerns unsupervised variable selection, where all variables are treated equally without making any difference between responses and inputs. The task is to detect the variables that contain, in some sense, as much information as possible. A related problem that is also examined is combining the two major categories of dimensionality reduction: variable selection and subspace projection. Simple modifications of the multiresponse regression techniques developed in this thesis offer a fresh approach to these unsupervised learning tasks. This is another contribution of the thesis. The third group of results concerns extensions and applications of the self-organizing map (SOM). The SOM is a prominent tool in the initial exploratory phase of multivariate analysis. It provides a clustering and a visual low-dimensional representation of a set of high-dimensional observations. Firstly, an extension of the SOM algorithm is proposed in this thesis, which is applicable to strongly curvilinear but intrinsically low-dimensional data structures. Secondly, an application of the SOM is proposed to interpret nonlinear quantile regression models. Thirdly, a SOM-based method is introduced for analyzing the dependency of one multivariate data set on another. Simila, T.

0a44d220aba049e09195a782f9f1e06f865c34fc,Characterizing CD137 upregulation on NK cells in patients receiving monoclonal antibody therapy,"Background
In the era of personalized cancer medicine, identifying techniques for effectively matching patients to efficacious treatments is a critical step in the treatment process. The advent of anti-cancer immunotherapies necessitates novel approaches to biomarker identification beyond traditional genomic profiling. One promising approach is incorporation of nomograms into treatment decisions. Nomograms are prediction tools, based on statistical modeling, designed to predict treatment outcomes. As a first step toward developing a nomogram, we conducted analyses to predict CD137 expression of natural killer cells after monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment.


Patients and methods
Patient, tumor and immune characteristics were collected from 199 patients with breast cancer (Nâ€‰=â€‰62), head/neck cancers (Nâ€‰=â€‰46) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (Nâ€‰=â€‰91), who were receiving mAb therapy as part of clinical trials. The difference in CD137 expression before and after mAb therapy was assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate those who respond to mAb therapy via increased CD137 expression, we applied classification and regression trees (CART), multivariable lasso regression tools and Random Forest.


Results
The CD137 expression was significantly different for each cancer type [mean (SD): Breast: 6.6 (6.5); Head/Neck: 11.0 (7.0); NHL: 7.5 (7.1), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001]. For breast cancer and NHL, FcR polymorphism and baseline CD137 expression were significant predictors of increased CD137 expression; for head/neck cancer, FcR polymorphism and age were significant predictors of increased expression.


Conclusions
Our preliminary results suggest that FcR polymorphism, pre-treatment CD137 expression and age are significant predictors of CD137 upregulation in patients. This study demonstrates that the development of a nomogram for therapy response is feasible. Further work validating our models in an independent cohort will provide the next steps in developing a nomogram that may be used to individualize this therapeutic approach for patients (NCT01114256).",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amani Makkouk"", ids = ""5067356""); list(name = ""Vandhana Sundaram"", ids = ""150334370""); list(name = ""Cristen Chester"", ids = ""1400455749""); list(name = ""S-J Chang"", ids = ""115332798""); list(name = ""Alexander Dimitrios Colevas"", ids = ""3083917""); list(name = ""John B Sunwoo"", ids = ""1807811""); list(name = ""Holden T.

With the increase need to use marginal donor, because of the limited pool of donor available, an algorithm to predict PGD following heart transplantation could help identify marginal donors that are still suitable for transplantation. Methods 64 patients who underwent heart transplantation procedure without the use of organ care system were analyzed. PGD was defined as described before (2) and was present in 21. Donor, procedural and Recipient factors were run in an machine learning algorithm with lasso regression based on the coordinate descent technique provided by the glmnet algorithm. The predictive algorithm was generated for the outcome Primary Graft Dysfunction by continuous cross-referencing and re-sampling. Depending on the importance and distribution of each predictor in the model was assigned a score. The sum score was tested in a ROC-analysis with optimal cut-off calculated Results The following variables were found to be high risk to develop PGD (in descendant order): Cardiopulmonary bypass time, units of red blood cells given, cold ischemia time, cardioplegia amount, Time from brain death to recovery, Troponin T level in donor, diabetes in recipient and post-op creatinine level were left for the final algorithm. Scores were assigned in proportion to the weight given to them in the algorithm.). A ROC- analyze for the prediction of PGD showed a AUC (95% conf interval) 0.93(0.86-0.99). The optimal cut off was determined at 10 (0-29) Conclusion GREAT score can intra -operatively be used to prepare the transplantation team for who needs post-procedural support.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marzia Leacche"", ids = ""7206661""); list(name = ""Penny Wilton"", ids = ""37862709""); list(name = ""Gemma Marco"", ids = ""90907798""); list(name = ""Stephen Fitch"", ids = ""14880059""); list(name = ""N.

Such highly structured sparse regression was denoted by Bach (Advances in neural information processing systems, pp 105â€“112, 2009) as sparse hierarchical regression in the context of kernel learning. Hierarchical sparse specification aligns well with modern big data settings where many inputs are not relevant for prediction purposes and the functional complexity of the regressor needs to be controlled as to avoid overfitting. We propose an efficient two-step approach to this hierarchical sparse regression problem. First, we discard irrelevant inputs using an extremely fast input ranking heuristic.

Crucially, the same transition also presents itself in our ability to reject all irrelevant features and monomials as well. In the regime where our method is statistically powerful, its computational complexity is interestingly on par with Lasso based heuristics. Hierarchical sparsity can retain the flexibility of general nonparametric methods such as nearest neighbors or regression trees (CART), without sacrificing much statistical power. The presented work hence fills a void in terms of a lack of powerful disciplined nonlinear sparse regression methods in high-dimensional settings.

The need to compare data in a multivariate manner arises naturally in observational studies, randomized trials, comparative effectiveness research, abnormality and anomaly detection scenarios, and other application areas. In such comparisons, it is of interest to identify statistical differences across the groups being compared. The approach we present in this paper addresses this issue by constructing statistical models that describe the groups being compared and using a decomposable Bayesian Dirichlet score of the models to identify variables that behave statistically differently between the groups. In our evaluation, the new method performed significantly better than logistic lasso regression in indentifying differences in a variety of datasets under a variety of conditions.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuriy Sverchkov"", ids = ""2933776""); list(name = ""Gregory F.

13b66e2b55458483d436318a89be5977bbbcdeb9,A two-microRNA-based signature predicts first-line chemotherapy outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer patients,"Prognostic and predictive markers are needed to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who receive standard first-line treatments. We performed a prospective cohort study in advanced CRC patients to identify a miRNA signature that could predict the benefit of receiving first-line chemotherapy for these patients. Twenty-one paired tumours and adjacent normal tissues were collected from advanced CRC patients and analysed by miRNA microarrays. Between tumour and normal tissues, 33 miRNAs were differentially expressed and was confirmed by qRT-PCR from another group of 67 patients from a prospective cohort study. A two-miRNA-based signature was obtained using the LASSO Cox regression model based on the association between the expression of each miRNA and the PFS of individual patients. Internal and external validation cohorts, including 40 and 44 patients with advanced CRC, respectively, were performed to prove the prognostic and predictive value of this signature. A signature was built based on two miRNAs, miR-125b-2-3p and miR-933. CRC patients were classified into low- and high-risk groups for disease progression based on this tool. The patients with low risk scores generally had better PFS than those with high risk scores. In the training set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 12.00 and 7.40 months, respectively. In the internal validation set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 9.90 and 5.10 months, respectively. In the external validation set, the median PFS in the low- and high-risk groups were 9.90 and 6.40 months, respectively. Furthermore, we detected miR-125b-2-3p associated with CRC cell sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy. Our two-miRNA-based signature was a reliable prognostic and predictive tool for tumour progression in patients with advanced CRC, and might be able to predict the benefit of receiving standard first-line chemotherapy in CRC.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jia-huan Lu"", ids = ""8688619""); list(name = ""Zhixiang Zuo"", ids = ""32653657""); list(name = ""Wei Wang"", ids = ""30297821""); list(name = ""Qi Dong Zhao"", ids = ""49033329""); list(name = ""Miao-Zhen Qiu"", ids = ""145262478""); list(name = ""Huiyan Luo"", ids = ""115722618""); list(name = ""Zhan-hong Chen"", ids = ""6772005""); list(name = ""Hai-yu Mo"", ids = ""4175177""); list(name = ""Feng Wang"", ids = ""46429008""); list(name = ""Dong-Dong Yang"", ids = ""49262994""); list(name = ""Yun Wang"", ids = ""1719525""); list(name = ""Xiao-li Wei"", ids = ""1807214""); list(name = ""Qi-nian Wu"", ids = ""8269077""); list(name = ""Huai-Qiang Ju"", ids = ""46369082""); list(name = ""Rui-Hua Xu"", ids = ""144187196""); list(name = ""Zhao-Lei Zeng"", ids = ""7801640"")",30fe402ea559e30c3fdfa269e500c175f72579f9,18d9f6216da1346b084bc220726905efcccba39b; c447845328762ef86268ce7ca552e6b49ebc8ee6; cd8c4ccb566ffbdb034d2f9430dbfb2fd6fdd5fe; 2412ec3775f97118b15e15e3302bc8fa88cab5ad; 3ed24b47563246fa12097a29cdeb7fd640009f40; 3660c8f5ff14ef466643477574f0b458b309d2cf; fc64e51db1b9d7096dbc9ea827cb7d0345f12fd9; 572bc13cdb73174f614b7c864b4fc306c9bb263c; a01b5e2e9b8cb6ac18f969e3b471916bb5087ff4; 494616b3c279860ff6881de4355f0060b9672b18; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; 5024d7771b60011a753bc51b0062d651d886ff08; 141c45b7731014eb0f876edb17a02c0ac96daff6; 0e423d26b195eb3ac49890201016c2366e949580; 67d6d92be6e740386b58ea8688310f50758750e1; 6d1ec4b05b4baedb6c0cee918c146b1a6edb709a; 57c30aa52bef21203fe694b2680383a9004b3f14; 963b739add74b8a0267bbfd904bfb5fa3b3f9d29; 10bae8b93245299d0e4c4079e76f4d8c10458709; 3c73ea6a9c982d53cd7e86a1154472dd4c15f5b5; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; b30a47d8a5027da4d8de41fdfd3607ded2461ce5; 0e4938628fa7594145c80cbf05d67f25ce8e5342; 4e29fb622af29eb8e05165824a827afc1d558170; a1a159240fc02a67d816f9e1ebced479da5f7f8a; 9780c92e7f81fef3d417c142796a6ac2fc21302a; d9aabb916114b7bf04504733ec37390bab76b717; 066a65dd36d95bdeff06ef703ba30b0c28397cd0; 6c074e7aab06f415d0bd7d7f22968354a86c03f8; 436a5cdaedd6f8924390e997ebc417689267aa2d; 2d76664c752551dfa3a9c70e10b00d9884df91da; 739315dc1368d18d43ac09932659506f5c94300b; c3965d029b5d0f3219bb98275d992a78ecdafee1; 7c3a8fadd7c6ead46108c5aa58c3acfef2d8c20e; 4518bd5f325c7cd5793847fa4a859fbac4c4ced0,Cell Death Discovery,4,
c4075b204975f519fabaf1a57e9ddb4b7cd18b50,Networkâ€based feature selection reveals substructures of gene modules responding to salt stress in rice,"Rice, an important food resource, is highly sensitive to salt stress, which is directly related to food security. Although many studies have identified physiological mechanisms that confer tolerance to the osmotic effects of salinity, the link between rice genotype and salt tolerance is not very clear yet. Association of gene co-expression network and rice phenotypic data under stress has penitential to identify stress-responsive genes, but there is no standard method to associate stress phenotype with gene co-expression network. A novel method for integration of gene co-expression network and stress phenotype data was developed to conduct a system analysis to link genotype to phenotype. We applied a LASSO-based method to the gene co-expression network of rice with salt stress to discover key genes and their interactions for salt tolerance-related phenotypes. Submodules in gene modules identified from the co-expression network were selected by the LASSO regression, which establishes a linear relationship between gene expression profiles and physiological responses, that is, sodium/potassium condenses under salt stress. Genes in these submodules have functions related to ion transport, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative tolerance. We argued that these genes in submodules are biologically meaningful and useful for studies on rice salt tolerance. This method can be applied to other studies to efficiently and reliably integrate co-expression network and phenotypic data.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qian Du"", ids = ""144486954""); list(name = ""Malachy T.

We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH [Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso, and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.

382cbea00099d3914ff9e24d7cdda42bc7954fbf,Identifying Latent Structures in Panel Data,"This paper provides a novel mechanism for identifying and estimating latent group structures in panel data using penalized regression techniques. We focus on linear models where the slope parameters are heterogeneous across groups but homogenous within a group and the group membership is unknown. Two approaches are considered -- penalized least squares (PLS) for models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) for models with endogeneity. In both cases we develop a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PLS estimation C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM estimation the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the approach both in classification and estimation. An empirical application investigating the determinants of cross-country savings rates finds two latent groups among 56 countries, providing empirical confirmation that higher savings rates go in hand with higher income growth.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Liangjun Su"", ids = ""40814278""); list(name = ""Zhentao Shi"", ids = ""3109998""); list(name = ""Peter C.

6ab9d98325637c790eab5815c6451f8f0d6e88fb,Accuracy of Genomic Selection Methods in a Standard Data Set of Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.),"Genomic selection can increase genetic gain per generation through early selection. Genomic selection is expected to be particularly valuable for traits that are costly to phenotype and expressed late in the life cycle of long-lived species. Alternative approaches to genomic selection prediction models may perform differently for traits with distinct genetic properties. Here the performance of four different original methods of genomic selection that differ with respect to assumptions regarding distribution of marker effects, including (i) ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), (ii) Bayes A, (iii) Bayes CÏ€, and (iv) Bayesian LASSO are presented. In addition, a modified RR-BLUP (RR-BLUP B) that utilizes a selected subset of markers was evaluated. The accuracy of these methods was compared across 17 traits with distinct heritabilities and genetic architectures, including growth, development, and disease-resistance properties, measured in a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) training population of 951 individuals genotyped with 4853 SNPs. The predictive ability of the methods was evaluated using a 10-fold, cross-validation approach, and differed only marginally for most method/trait combinations. Interestingly, for fusiform rust disease-resistance traits, Bayes CÏ€, Bayes A, and RR-BLUB B had higher predictive ability than RR-BLUP and Bayesian LASSO. Fusiform rust is controlled by few genes of large effect. A limitation of RR-BLUP is the assumption of equal contribution of all markers to the observed variation. However, RR-BLUP B performed equally well as the Bayesian approaches.The genotypic and phenotypic data used in this study are publically available for comparative analysis of genomic selection prediction models.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MÃ¡rcio Fernando Ribeiro Resende"", ids = ""38385016""); list(name = ""Patricio Munoz"", ids = ""153770357""); list(name = ""Marcos Dv de Resende"", ids = ""145749590""); list(name = ""Dorian J Garrick"", ids = ""3862998""); list(name = ""Rohan L.

4d5771ae6e06977847c224af1ca1ee5131c8332b,A Modified Least Angle Regression Algorithm for Hierarchical Interaction,"Variable selection is important in high dimensional regression. Traditional variable selection methods such as stepwise selection are unstable which means that the set of the selected variables is sensitive according to the change of data sets. As an alternative to those methods, a series of sparse penalized methods are used for estimation and variable selection simultaneously. The full set of LASSO solutions can be calculated by a minor modification of the LARS algorithm. In many important practical problems, the main effect alone may not be enough to capture the relationship between the response and predictors, and high-order interactions are often of interest to scientific researchers. In considering two-way interaction models with a large number of covariates, we often would like to determine a smaller subset that exhibits strong effects on the response variable have been suggested.

These techniques have proved robust in other fields for dealing with the curse of dimensionality, a situation often encountered in applied stress testing. Lasso regressions, in particular, are well suited for building forecasting models when the number of potential covariates is large, and the number of observations is small or roughly equal to the number of covariates.

0b9a519984f25a08be1ab838b1dfe96fcfe24f7b,M-estimation for robust sparse unmixing of hyperspectral images,"Hyperspectral unmixing methods often use a conventional least squares based lasso which assumes that the data follows the Gaussian distribution. The normality assumption is an approximation which is generally invalid for real imagery data. We consider a robust (non-Gaussian) approach to sparse spectral unmixing of remotely sensed imagery which reduces the sensitivity of the estimator to outliers and relaxes the linearity assumption. The method consists of several appropriate penalties. We propose to use an â„“p norm with 0 < p < 1 in the sparse regression problem, which induces more sparsity in the results, but makes the problem non-convex. On the other hand, the problem, though non-convex, can be solved quite straightforwardly with an extensible algorithm based on iteratively reweighted least squares. To deal with the huge size of modern spectral libraries we introduce a library reduction step, similar to the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) array processing algorithm, which not only speeds up unmixing but also yields superior results. In the hyperspectral setting we extend the traditional least squares method to the robust heavy-tailed case and propose a generalised M-lasso solution. M-estimation replaces the Gaussian likelihood with a fixed function Ï(e) that restrains outliers. The M-estimate function reduces the effect of errors with large amplitudes or even assigns the outliers zero weights. Our experimental results on real hyperspectral data show that noise with large amplitudes (outliers) often exists in the data. This ability to mitigate the influence of such outliers can therefore offer greater robustness. Qualitative hyperspectral unmixing results on real hyperspectral image data corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method.",2016,Engineering; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Maria Toomik"", ids = ""104188705""); list(name = ""Shijian Lu"", ids = ""1771189""); list(name = ""James D.

11f8534eaf11fbd74f9226d137584ae7cf44639e,Increased Inflammatory Activity in Patients 3 Months after Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries.,"BACKGROUND
Around 5%-10% of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) present with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). We aimed to assess pathophysiological mechanisms in MINOCA by extensively evaluating cardiovascular biomarkers in the stable phase after an event, comparing MINOCA patients with cardiovascular healthy controls and MI patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD).


METHODS
Ninety-one biomarkers were measured with a proximity extension assay 3 months after MI in 97 MINOCA patients, 97 age- and sex-matched MI-CAD patients, and 98 controls. Lasso analyses (penalized logistic regression models) and adjusted multiple linear regression models were used for statistical analyses.


RESULTS
In the Lasso analysis (MINOCA vs MI-CAD), 8 biomarkers provided discriminatory value: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, C-X-C motif chemokine 1, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine, and pappalysin-1 (PAPPA) with increasing probabilities of MINOCA, and, tissue-type plasminogen activator, B-type natriuretic peptide, myeloperoxidase, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein with increasing probabilities of MI-CAD. Comparing MINOCA vs controls, 7 biomarkers provided discriminatory value: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, renin, NF-Îº-B essential modulator, PAPPA, interleukin-6, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor with increasing probabilities of MINOCA, and agouti-related protein with increasing probabilities of controls. Adjusted multiple linear regression analyses showed that group affiliation was associated with the concentrations of 7 of the 8 biomarkers in the comparison MINOCA vs MI-CAD and 5 of the 7 biomarkers in MINOCA vs controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Three months after the MI, the biomarker concentrations indicated greater inflammatory activity in MINOCA patients than in both MI-CAD patients and healthy controls, and a varying degree of myocardial dysfunction among the 3 cohorts.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marcus Hjort"", ids = ""4657479""); list(name = ""Kai M.

45e2d6dbcdba527a4e7e5414cd16e1b32ffedba1,A Scaling and Non-Negative Garrote in Soft-Thresholding,"Soft-thresholding is a sparse modeling method typically applied to wavelet denoising in statistical signal processing. It is also important in machine learning since it is an essential nature of the well-known LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). It is known that soft-thresholding, thus, LASSO suffers from a problem of dilemma between sparsity and generalization. This is caused by excessive shrinkage at a sparse representation. There are several methods for improving this problem in the field of signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we considered to extend and analyze a method of scaling of soft-thresholding estimators. In a setting of non-parametric orthogonal regression problem including discrete wavelet transform, we introduced component-wise and data-dependent scaling that is indeed identical to non-negative garrote. We here considered a case where a parameter value of soft-thresholding is chosen from absolute values of the least squares estimates, by which the model selection problem reduces to the determination of the number of non-zero coefficient estimates. In this case, we firstly derived a risk and construct SURE (Steinâ€™s unbiased risk estimator) that can be used for determining the number of non-zero coefficient estimates. We also analyzed some properties of the risk curve and found that our scaling method with the derived SURE is possible to yield a model with low risk and high sparsity compared to a naive soft-thresholding method with SURE. This theoretical speculation was verified by a simple numerical experiment of wavelet denoising. key words: soft-thresholding, SURE, non-negative garrote, scaling, wavelet denoising",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Katsuyuki Hagiwara"", ids = ""39429983"")",ad56e93171297205b86dd5dac5e34bcddca79332,58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 2b4d8ffdca5e3a39e4eaeee382b7c5350162a3e4; ef767b585b5d72e2194060060100d349b1f0486d; 8cc9918add61ee5ef3b848aba9646169cc5e364e; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 3681afccac08d7d39fe740863663f4c0fa7f3cd6; cbaf5ea0b865bcbecd0d3ce59866332051a01422; c55427af7465ed571dab965ac5b7d3dd8f2bab9b; 1f682ca3764274b07d34382377b90a38dc3df452; 27f9e113e52426b135ddea38f2764e92a489b06b; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 70da52472f81d3566366eb600fed647a8bf4d46d; c8dccd0ceb3ce4bb22252f847eba66ab4a7a9e21; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; e2cbebb77eda911480a6fe47591c6ba6697c055e; dc423c0563ac6c80ae8af840c8560438644a0e59; 99eb3005e85f1528269aa09b5417d6ce51a33c87,IEICE Trans.

A logistic model is obtained by setting the logarithmic odds ratio equal to a linear combination of the inputs. As with any statistical model, logistic models will suffer from overfitting if the number of inputs is comparable to the number of forecast instances. Computational approaches to avoid overfitting by regularization are discussed, and efficient techniques for model assessment and selection are presented. A logit version of the lasso (originally a linear regression technique), is discussed. In lasso models, less important inputs are identified and the corresponding coefficient is set to zero, providing an efficient and automatic model reduction procedure. For the same reason, lasso models are particularly appealing for diagnostic purposes.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jochen BrÃ¶cker"", ids = ""2955183"")",f9f161a0e814061a85f50f66a8e4da48f304b166; 6a88d7f93d52dc81673a0f1be1e5909687e66667,,Monthly Weather Review,138,592-604
b6fed304d3f3d48e5cfa15f67dedea7d30f569ec,Differential co-expression network centrality and machine learning feature selection for identifying susceptibility hubs in networks with scale-free structure,"BackgroundBiological insights into group differences, such as disease status, have been achieved through differential co-expression analysis of microarray data. Additional understanding of group differences may be achieved by integrating the connectivity structure of the differential co-expression network and per-gene differential expression between phenotypic groups. Such a global differential co-expression network strategy may increase sensitivity to detect gene-gene interactions (or expression epistasis) that may act as candidates for rewiring susceptibility co-expression networks.MethodsWe test two methods for inferring Genetic Association Interaction Networks (GAIN) incorporating both differential co-expression effects and differential expression effects: a generalized linear model (GLM) regression method with interaction effects (reGAIN) and a Fisher test method for correlation differences (dcGAIN). We rank the importance of each gene with complete interaction network centrality (CINC), which integrates each geneâ€™s differential co-expression effects in the GAIN model along with each geneâ€™s individual differential expression measure. We compare these methods with statistical learning methods Relief-F, Random Forests and Lasso. We also develop a mixture model and permutation approach for determining significant importance score thresholds for network centralities, Relief-F and Random Forest. We introduce a novel simulation strategy that generates microarray caseâ€“control data with embedded differential co-expression networks and underlying correlation structure based on scale-free or Erdos-Renyi (ER) random networks.ResultsUsing the network simulation strategy, we find that Relief-F and reGAIN provide the best balance between detecting interactions and main effects, plus reGAIN has the ability to adjust for covariates and model quantitative traits. The dcGAIN approach performs best at finding differential co-expression effects by design but worst for main effects, and it does not adjust for covariates and is limited to dichotomous outcomes. When the underlying network is scale free instead of ER, all interaction network methods have greater power to find differential co-expression effects. We apply these methods to a public microarray study of the differential immune response to influenza vaccine, and we identify effects that suggest a role in influenza vaccine immune response for genes from the PI3K family, which includes genes with known immunodeficiency function, and KLRG1, which is a known marker of senescence.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Caleb A.
