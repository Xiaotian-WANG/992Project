6c24ab529b9a743df193e1e5a19fcc237251ce68,Identifying prognostic intratumor heterogeneity using pre- and post-radiotherapy 18F-FDG PET images for pancreatic cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND
To stratify risks of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) patients using pre- and post-radiotherapy (RT) PET/CT images, and to assess the prognostic value of texture variations in predicting therapy response of patients.


METHODS
Twenty-six PA patients treated with RT from 2011-2013 with pre- and post-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans were identified. Tumor locoregional texture was calculated using 3D kernel-based approach, and texture variations were identified by fitting discrepancies of texture maps of pre- and post-treatment images. A total of 48 texture and clinical variables were identified and evaluated for association with overall survival (OS). The prognostic heterogeneity features were selected using lasso/elastic net regression, and further were evaluated by multivariate Cox analysis.


RESULTS
Median age was 69 y (range, 46-86 y). The texture map and temporal variations between pre- and post-treatment were well characterized by histograms and statistical fitting. The lasso analysis identified seven predictors (age, node stage, post-RT SUVmax, variations of homogeneity, variance, sum mean, and cluster tendency). The multivariate Cox analysis identified five significant variables: age, node stage, variations of homogeneity, variance, and cluster tendency (with P=0.020, 0.040, 0.065, 0.078, and 0.081, respectively). The patients were stratified into two groups based on the risk score of multivariate analysis with log-rank P=0.001: a low risk group (n=11) with a longer mean OS (29.3 months) and higher texture variation (>30%), and a high risk group (n=15) with a shorter mean OS (17.7 months) and lower texture variation (<15%).


CONCLUSIONS
Locoregional metabolic texture response provides a feasible approach for evaluating and predicting clinical outcomes following treatment of PA with RT. The proposed method can be used to stratify patient risk and help select appropriate treatment strategies for individual patients toward implementing response-driven adaptive RT.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yong Wei Yue"", ids = ""40141407""); list(name = ""Arsen Osipov"", ids = ""36870806""); list(name = ""Benedick A.

3f1a9b1902d851129b7036b8ebf6c02d1014f8d9,[Predictive mortality factors and the development of major complications in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"Our aim was to analyze death prognostic factors in the first six months or the development of major neurological complications (delayed brain ischaemia and rebleeding) or general complications (cardiorespiratory, hydroelectrolytic or infectious) in non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. We carried out an observational study of a historical cohort of 111 patients admitted consecutively to our Centre between 1986 and 1992 and who were diagnosed as having subarachnoid haemorrhage based upon clinical data and confirmed in all cases by brain computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or lumbar puncture. Clinical variables upon admission were collected prospectively and radiological data were obtained retrospectively. We performed a logistic regression analysis which showed as significant predictive variables for death in the first six months a score on the Hunt-Hess scale greater than 2, a score on the Glassow scale of less than 9, female, aged over 50 and rebleeding. As predictive factors for delayed brain ischaemia we identified the female sex and the existence of earlier general complications. In the development of rebleeding a significant predictive factor was high blood pressure antecedents although this may have been controlled upon admission. For the appearance of general complications, significant predictive factors were more than 2 on the Hunt-Hess scale and hypertension antecedents. The use of these predictive parameters may help evaluate a prognosis in subarachnoid haemorrhage patients and also help make decisions in the management of this pathology.",1996,Medicine,"list(name = ""E Botia"", ids = ""8291052""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Vivancos"", ids = ""145609396""); list(name = ""Teresa LeÃ³n"", ids = ""144059719""); list(name = ""TomÃ¡s Segura"", ids = ""152383203""); list(name = ""ConcepciÃ³n FernÃ¡ndez-GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""77839899""); list(name = ""Fernando Lopez-Lopez"", ids = ""1406628358"")",a550ab2d384527f9fc005fae4ead7ab66ad24280,,Revista de neurologia,24 126,"

We discuss the well known bridge estimators, Lasso and adaptive Lasso and a new class of weighted penalized least squares methods, which address the problem of heteroscedasticity. We give a careful explanation on how the choice of the regularizing parameter affects the quality of the statistical inference (such as conservative or consistent model selection). The new estimators are asymptotically (pointwise) as efficient as estimators which are assisted by a model selection oracle. The results are illustrated by means of a small simulation study and the analysis of a data example.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Holger Dette"", ids = ""2531020""); list(name = ""Jens Wagener"", ids = ""3257897"")",,,,,135-147

Developing a technology for quick OSA screening is momentous. In this study, we used regularized logistic regression to predict the OSA severity level of 199 individuals (116 males) with apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥ 15 (moderate/severe OSA) and AHI < 5 (non-OSA) using their tracheal breathing sounds (TBS) recorded during daytime, while they were awake. The participants were guided to breathe through their nose, and then through their mouth at their deep breathing rate. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection approach was used to select the discriminative features from the power spectra of the TBS and the anthropometric information. Using a five-fold cross-validation procedure, five different training sets and their corresponding blind-testing sets were formed. The average blind-testing classification accuracy over the five different folds was found to be 79.3% Â± 6.1 with the sensitivity (specificity) of 82.2% Â± 7.2% (75.8% Â± 9.9%). The accuracy for the entire dataset was found to be 81.1% with sensitivity (specificity) of 84.4% (77.0%). The feature selection and classification procedures were intelligible and fast. The selected features were physiologically meaningful. Overall, the results show that TBS analysis can be used as a quick and reliable prediction of the presence and severity of OSA during wakefulness without a sleep study.

a2ee07377cbeb0d53e9d3e9a71c865143fadfea1,Penalized regression via the restricted bridge estimator.,"This article is concerned with the Bridge Regression, which is a special family in penalized regression with penalty function $\sum_{j=1}^{p}|\beta_j|^q$ with $q>0$, in a linear model with linear restrictions. The proposed restricted bridge (RBRIDGE) estimator simultaneously estimates parameters and selects important variables when a prior information about parameters are available in either low dimensional or high dimensional case. Using local quadratic approximation, the penalty term can be approximated around a local initial values vector and the RBRIDGE estimator enjoys a closed-form expression which can be solved when $q>0$. Special cases of our proposal are the restricted LASSO ($q=1$), restricted RIDGE ($q=2$), and restricted Elastic Net ($1< q < 2$) estimators. We provide some theoretical properties of the RBRIDGE estimator under for the low dimensional case, whereas the computational aspects are given for both low and high dimensional cases. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted based on different prior pieces of information and the performance of the RBRIDGE estiamtor is compared with some competitive penalty estimators as well as the ORACLE. We also consider four real data examples analysis for comparison sake. The numerical results show that the suggested RBRIDGE estimator outperforms outstandingly when the prior is true or near exact",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bahadir Yuzbacsi"", ids = ""88873854""); list(name = ""Mohammad Arashi"", ids = ""1817895""); list(name = ""Fikri Akdeniz"", ids = ""1911293"")",,97ee605ad30ee08dd09176c5e491f3af8348d7a1; 450348ce425151292d27360f4ed0750783714b54; a6f2edec04dad5538ccccb66829b5cfdff7fcd20; 215e7a83c2d188bacf6b43e65a7990fd16203cae; d570451224dc9411d2629418e33128a50fc3b1b9; 019b126e45001dbfc28e72943449bc42bd08df7b; 4b8a0d5fe4327b737fef8a901635053f56929fc4; c44ebb438b173b98bf6bbef2ed75147a4f5bdc5e; 5df344fbb19b98f2375ef94543c26beb4b8fdc4e; 242c0695b371c77d565cd4efc2b4638f00a01efd; 2eeaa750b8bcbfa0ddd6fafdd8a56c126ea8e1e3; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d4bd5ad4f424ea4ed9d8f5fd3a0ff99b5e38ae4e; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; 697de7bd7b3f5bd211e1a40ae57b4edbbb781fa7; 1473110f6c33b483251ade10b79416d3efee2da4; 399a738c138a789dd7329edba8816cd7fbde42ed; 1d3157cbb0aec9599b44b059d74506de4a847084; 720695e212762e682ca4e59ff264257c9c4e0bb8; 745562e58330f82c7b2bc6625aa3f990b83d7023; 692ecee903dcfc6405d84fcfb653f5e04ca81a76; 0b003a1c2e8af834832337c30adadb329ca665dd; 2f1c271ff973445d3f5efc600855ec0dd1fd110b; 505be76107f238299049c4fb78d9e8a0654e8e4d; 9cf3d2dd18f2af99335234d6942da98503a83b2c; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; 533915d922c64903e4a4013a78ec03b91f522fc5; 2e2bab76f1aec87b7aa0071d12074f2dbf46121c; e6db99fd95b7cd98f218bb44235aece8051cfcf0; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 35eba9424c1a07b3e90d30f821619001550abc89; b85902e1382a799b683c3907f57c896c9497f1cb; 0c846f1cfe551b455e910b5c1e58ed432381c957,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
f120530926387e879b6a1303c8302b2a31875b84,Reconstructing ecological networks with hierarchical Bayesian regression and Mondrian processes,"Ecological systems consist of complex sets of interactions among species and their environment, the understanding of which has implications for predicting environmental response to perturbations such as invading species and climate change. However, the revelation of these interactions is not straightforward, nor are the interactions necessarily stable across space. Machine learning can enable the recovery of such complex, spatially varying interactions from relatively easily obtained species abundance data. Here, we describe a novel Bayesian regression and Mondrian process model (BRAMP) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed field data. BRAMP enables robust inference of species interactions considering autocorrelation in species abundances and allowing for variation in the interactions across space. We evaluate the model on spatially explicit simulated data, produced using a trophic niche model combined with stochastic population dynamics. We compare the modelâ€™s performance against L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme.

1790794951f887f957cd319d735848619fdf1470,Predicting the risk of sarcopenia in elderly patients with patellar fracture: Development and assessment of a new predictive nomogram,"Purpose This study was aimed at developing a risk prediction model for postoperative dysplasia in elderly patients with patellar fractures in China. Patients and methods We conducted a community survey of patients aged â‰¥55 years who underwent surgery for patellar fractures between January 2013 and October 2018, through telephone interviews, community visits, and outpatient follow-up. We established a predictive model for assessing the risk of sarcopenia after patellar fractures. We developed the prediction model by combining multivariate logistic regression analysis with the least absolute shrinkage model and selection operator regression (Lasso analysis). The predictive quality and clinical utility of the predictive model were determined using C-index, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. We conducted internal sampling methods for qualitative assessment. Result We recruited 61 participants (males: 20, mean age: 68.1 years). Various risk factors were assessed, and low body mass index and diabetes mellitus were identified as the most important risk factors (P<0.05). The model showed a good prediction rate (C-index: 0.909; 95% confidence interval: 0.81â€“1.00) and good correction effect. The C-index remained high (0.828) even after internal sample verification. Decision curve analysis showed that the risk of sarcopenia was 8.3â€“80.0%, suggesting good clinical practicability. Conclusion Our prediction model shows promise as a cost-effective tool for predicting the risk of postoperative sarcopenia in elderly patients based on the following: advanced age, low body mass index, diabetes, longer postoperative hospital stay, no higher education, no postoperative rehabilitation, removal of internal fixation, and less outdoor exercise.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Chen Yi-sheng"", ids = ""52427522""); list(name = ""Tao Jie"", ids = ""151232356"")",,302aa727181caf120d2b9c479ab74152ab498f48; 145873b7f326100ce91c1b735c6f7bd5837729e0; ea2080de11d715bb0a7fe5bd83c4da096ab7f41a; 3c56fce30ecb0e77c93458bf0fbc85a0747736ea; 3c405e27bfc70e7315714d3ffe1d3368a9848115; 802269ab7e59440e6a88a85a005f085901e89c29; bee848fd1d9548dafc340f62ff92bfa04d10125b; 0a5002a6bd5f967c75ae6d3ad046fa7559441399; bb07483b8c9d145246cdf4bfc4c4b1661cfe5496; 893183f444b96b9e95a8ff814be1cc90ee2b0ff5; f566549b0229716ec310d033b6396f5ac19be760; d5900993d9088ecb7f1efe4bcdd88694b5e639eb; 33e88f125e3d1bbd70fa954f10468c074e681e60; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; bf0c01cfcea005452ae3cc46bdb828e7d9533b80; 65946bdc19ef2f4a751b9e400a7abb82e82e51be; 67514df9b9db3b97732276de1d8587969ac4de2a; a957f5da5573e5451280ee8b7951046b166d045b; 1743b725e07d78f59ea2a370eef838a7c4eb6492; 57a4e2317614535d1caf257c7e6495baca2c8250; d1a35039e280c5764ed8b2c5d6ed400fc3cc1c5b; 6614319626034f030c6fde8434cddcb191616268; 3ce39a141fcaa7c11079cfca8cc2508844cffab4; 7a68a9d9b29e8ea1cef6a712a34b4c4a98082262; 544c8319ccfcd131a3359040e3b139e0f98c0aa7; 98a666ee7cc022b2f9b524158636ed9852b89acb; 5c733b6b84ea8b8d1bd51884a6e131aca51a58f9; 4c98183e077634a5fe136e1af3a585ab4d00d617; 5a015f5be17f9115196e45b8584d4fd028c53ff5; 1ce7a232c1770a033e9dc39c37cd9e6063d16dfb; 49ae116728bb3ce9ec52f2b17572a0b93f812089; 77a12107f2a8fe81bb2b23ceb80d7e5b641cfe09; 164fbc5564b59dc69de7bae8cefe97cf159364ab; 3c22b9d70321076ccf3a145e128b34d9858fcb15; 337cf799c44ecd4b8a0515be455c455b9cf4a62f; cd67c5d2bc2a2691ff285dfb67be0c5aca5e23d2; 74389272da83ca408b915f932e89be37df78b142; a4ba2ed08995d32e83af461cf9827d8cea8266b8; 7f61a8798989e0a003b87bddf296af63811054b1; 444c48e4344bcf3b583389b35a084d7fbfffcf54; 4d766af2687d3603a9b59b9245a44494236e72e9; 23c2e91605d4bf4046757762727643dc1d75e83a; c7fc7a808e5c5631d3832c683f524c03764cc30d; 95b1a5d277afa111f1006a241c57a78e3d67414a; 06859a463f3c9474addb5765d7a2381add2c75ea; 64272d5388cec9804cec559b9bbe2e58c2583861; 55ea22d52e0e4b440a8db4523e594611154f6b0b; 71c8cf4c13de10510e536c0d81f4dc3691e086c3; 515cf77a545f13ec211a57bbafd2bdd5bab92e9d; b393e63bf733dd36e1dddde24dafb8128115bf18; bf254c50155a8898595d111b0b202e5b5fa2ca48; e69699a2566526d0faed0352483a0082154eccde; 8fd2c1fd76b789992c0a231a53eab723a4a79f18; 94283d259a506af9a4afd2a5fb8cb495ed01b64e,bioRxiv,,

Along this perspective, the aims of present research were to compare genetic evaluation models that assume or not marker effects in the estimation of breeding values, as well as to estimate the allelic substitution effects of SNP markers, by applying six different methods (Bayesian multiple regression, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes CÏ€, and Bayesian Lasso), and to evaluate the impact of these effects on the reliability of breeding values and the divergences in animal classification based on classical breeding values and markerassisted breeding values. Data of 83,404 animals belonging to a Nellore beef cattle (Bos indicus) selection program, measured for post-weaning gain, scrotal circumference and muscle score, and corresponding to 116,562 animals in the relationship matrix, were used. From these animals, a set of 3160 animals with phenotypic and genealogy data available were genotyped with a panel of 106 SNP markers.

253d0c8b534ff5250b07899f21c7373160609e3d,On Regularisation Methods for Analysis of High Dimensional Data,"High dimensional data are rapidly growing in many domains due to the development of technological advances which helps collect data with a large number of variables to better understand a given phenomenon of interest. Particular examples appear in genomics, fMRI data analysis, large-scale healthcare analytics, text/image analysis and astronomy. In the last two decades regularisation approaches have become the methods of choice for analysing such high dimensional data. This paper aims to study the performance of regularisation methods, including the recently proposed method called de-biased lasso, for the analysis of high dimensional data under different sparse and non-sparse situations. Our investigation concerns prediction, parameter estimation and variable selection. We particularly study the effects of correlated variables, covariate location and effect size which have not been well investigated. We find that correlated data when associated with important variables improve those common regularisation methods in all aspects, and that the level of sparsity can be reflected not only from the number of important variables but also from their overall effect size and locations. The latter may be seen under a non-sparse data structure. We demonstrate that the de-biased lasso performs well especially in low dimensional data, however it still suffers from issues, such as multicollinearity and multiple hypothesis testing, similar to the classical regression methods.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tanin Sirimongkolkasem"", ids = ""118342121""); list(name = ""Reza Drikvandi"", ids = ""2404967"")",,,Annals of Data Science,,1-27

In the linear model, the Lasso is an effective way of selecting variables using penalized regression. It has spawned substantial research in the area of variable selection for models that depend on a linear combination of predictors. However, work addressing the lack of optimality of variable selection when the model errors are not Gaussian and/or when the data contain gross outliers is scarce. We propose the weighted signed-rank Lasso as a robust and efficient alternative to least absolute deviations and least squares Lasso. The approach is appealing for use with big data since one can use data augmentation to perform the estimation as a single weighted L1 optimization problem.

463417caf84d9e7d4c93a106257cca8a88963cba,Prognostic Value of a Long Non-coding RNA Signature in Localized Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be used as prognostic biomarkers in many types of cancer.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to establish an lncRNA signature to improve postoperative risk stratification for patients with localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Based on the RNA-seq data of 444 stage I-III ccRCC tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we built a four-lncRNA-based classifier using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) Cox regression model in 222 randomly selected samples (training set) and validated the classifier in the remaining 222 samples (internal validation set). We confirmed this classifier in an external validation set of 88 patients with stage I-III ccRCC from a Japan cohort and using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in another three independent sets that included 1869 patients from China with stage I-III ccRCC.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Univariable and multivariable Cox regression, Harrell's concordance index (c-index), and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the association of the classifier with overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
Using the LASSO Cox regression model, we built a classifier named RCClnc4 based on four lncRNAs: ENSG00000255774, ENSG00000248323, ENSG00000260911, and ENSG00000231666. In the RNA-seq and RT-PCR data sets, the RCClnc4 signature significantly stratified patients into high-risk versus low-risk groups in terms of clinical outcome across and within subpopulations and remained as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio range, 1.34 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.03-1.75; p=0.028] to 1.89 [95% CI, 1.55-2.31; p<0.001]) after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. The RCClnc4 signature achieved a higher accuracy (mean c-index, 0.72) than clinical staging systems such as TNM (mean c-index, 0.62) and the stage, size, grade, and necrosis (SSIGN) score (mean c-index, 0.64), currently reported prognostic signatures and biomarkers for the estimation of survival. When integrated with clinical characteristics, the composite clinical and lncRNA signature showed improved prognostic accuracy in all data sets (TNM + RCClnc4 mean c-index, 0.75; SSIGN + RCClnc4 score mean c-index, 0.75). The RCClnc4 classifier was able to identify a clinically significant number of both high-risk stage I and low-risk stage II-III patients.


CONCLUSIONS
The RCClnc4 classifier is a promising and potential prognostic tool in predicting the survival of patients with stage I-III ccRCC. Combining the lncRNA classifier with clinical and pathological parameters allows for accurate risk assessment in guiding clinical management.

Functional networks, after downstream analysis, can provide key insights into the nature of neurobiological structure and computation. The validity of such insights hinges on accurate selection and estimation of the edges connecting nodes. However, commonly used statistical inference procedures generally fail to identify the correct features, and further introduce consequential bias in the estimates. To address these issues, we developed Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced statistical feature selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform feature selection and feature estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. In the context of linear regression (specifically UoILasso), we summarize extensive numerical investigation on synthetic data to demonstrate tight control of false-positives and false-negatives in feature selection with low-bias and low-variance estimates of selected parameters, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We demonstrate, with UoILasso, the extraction of sparse, predictive, and interpretable functional networks from human electrocorticography recordings during speech production and the inference of parsimonious coupling models from nonhuman primate single-unit recordings during reaching tasks. Our results establish that UoILasso generates interpretable and predictive functional connectivity networks.",2019,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pratik S.

Their LN metastases were pathologically confirmed. The first half of this cohort (90 patients) was set as the training cohort, and the second half (91 patients) was set as the validation cohort. A total of 1578 radiomic features were extracted from MR images (T2-TSE-BLADE and contrast-enhanced StarVIBE). The lasso and elastic net regression model was exploited for dimension reduction and selection of the feature space. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was adopted to identify the radiomic signature of pathologically involved LNs. The discriminating performance was assessed with the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The Mann-Whitney U test was adopted for testing the potential correlation of the radiomic signature and the LN status in both training and validation cohorts.ResultsNine radiomic features were selected to create the radiomic signature significantly associated with LN metastasis (p < 0.001). AUC of radiomic signature performance in the training cohort was 0.821 (95% CI: 0.7042-0.9376) and in the validation cohort was 0.762 (95% CI: 0.7127-0.812). This model showed good discrimination between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes.ConclusionThe present study showed MRI radiomic features that could potentially predict metastatic LN involvement in the preoperative evaluation of EC patients.Key Pointsâ€¢ The role of MRI in preoperative staging of esophageal cancer patients is increasing.â€¢ MRI radiomic features showed the ability to predict LN metastasis in EC patients.â€¢ ICCs showed excellent interreader agreement of the extracted MR features.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jinrong Qu"", ids = ""4830068""); list(name = ""Chen Shen"", ids = ""144097530""); list(name = ""Jianjun Qin"", ids = ""47901133""); list(name = ""Zhaoqi Wang"", ids = ""47196171""); list(name = ""Zhenyu Liu"", ids = ""144981066""); list(name = ""Jia Peng Guo"", ids = ""47093353""); list(name = ""Hongkai Zhang"", ids = ""49724359""); list(name = ""Pengrui Gao"", ids = ""51138254""); list(name = ""Tianxia Bei"", ids = ""51135387""); list(name = ""Yingshu Wang"", ids = ""7707693""); list(name = ""Hui Liu"", ids = ""48446904""); list(name = ""Ihab R.

03ba007946410f0783ee46213015c9ef5ca3207a,Selection of stable features for modeling 4-D affective space from EEG recording,"Recent advances in neuroscience made it possible to understand how the human brain processes emotions and affective states. However, the modeling of emotion remains elusive due to inherent ambiguity and complexity related to the perception of emotions, interpersonal variabilities, and context-specific interpretations. Here, we present a robust method of modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like, and Dominance). First, we determined the functional areas and frequency bands related to 4-D affective space. Second, we extracted and selected a set of stable features. For both steps, we used two different feature selection methods namely: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and stability selection method. Moreover, compare their performances. For the RFE, we used Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Tree-based bagging, and for the stability selection, we used Randomized Lasso as an estimator. Empirical analysis on the DEAP data set shows that the stability selection method consistently provides relevant set of bands, electrode location and features over a range of model parameters. We also observed that only a small number of locations (40%â€“63%) and certain frequency bands specifically, gamma band frequency over Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, and Somatosensory Association Cortex were the highest ranked features across the affective dimensions. The selected features using the stability criteria were used to model 4-D affective space using SVR. Empirical analyses shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Like are 2.13, 2.00, 2.07, and 2.11 respectively. In addition, we also compare the performance of this method with feature fusion and ensemble classification. It was observed that the SVR with selected features outperformed all other approaches. The predicted Valence-Arousal-Dominance were converted to categorical emotions for seamless interpretation.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Rakib Al-Fahad"", ids = ""1404335751""); list(name = ""Mohammed Yeasin"", ids = ""1828610""); list(name = ""A.

3043d358db07a798d1e2bb3a44fba1db3ecce7c7,"Health Effects of PM 2 . 5 and Its Components on Mortality , Blood Pressure , and DNA Methylation","Epidemiological studies have examined the association between PM2.5 mass and mortality, but there remains uncertainty about the relative importance of species. PM2.5 contains various species, such as organic carbon, elemental carbon, and metals. Determining the differential toxicity of PM2.5 species and identifying species with greatest toxicity is of great importance to emissioncontrol strategies and regulations. In the dissertation thesis, effects of PM2.5 species on health outcomes on different levels were estimated. The first study examined the association between PM2.5 species and mortality on approximately 4.5 million deaths for all causes, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory diseases in 75 U.S. cities for 2000-2006, using city-season specific Poisson regression and multivariate meta-regression controlled for infiltration. Since cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death within U.S. population, the second study aimed to determine which PM2.5 species are associated with blood pressure, an indicator of cardiovascular health, in a longitudinal cohort. Linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty were applied to longitudinal data from 718 elderly men in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS),",2018,,"list(name = ""Petros Koutrakis"", ids = ""5014576""); list(name = ""Brent A.

We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce highly efficient coordinate ascent algorithms for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our MAP estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ray Bai"", ids = ""40868793""); list(name = ""Gemma E.

dba48343eec6ce9f9ce328abd64e2e59f09bf822,eNetXplorer: an R package for the quantitative exploration of elastic net families for generalized linear models,"Background Regularized generalized linear models (GLMs) are popular regression methods in bioinformatics, particularly useful in scenarios with fewer observations than parameters/features or when many of the features are correlated. In both ridge and lasso regularization, feature shrinkage is controlled by a penalty parameter Î». The elastic net introduces a mixing parameter Î± to tune the shrinkage continuously from ridge to lasso. Selecting Î± objectively and determining which features contributed significantly to prediction after model fitting remain a practical challenge given the paucity of available software to evaluate performance and statistical significance. Results eNetXplorer builds on top of glmnet to address the above issues for linear (Gaussian), binomial (logistic), and multinomial GLMs. It provides new functionalities to empower practical applications by using a cross validation framework that assesses the predictive performance and statistical significance of a family of elastic net models (as Î± is varied) and of the corresponding features that contribute to prediction. The user can select which quality metrics to use to quantify the concordance between predicted and observed values, with defaults provided for each GLM. Statistical significance for each model (as defined by Î±) is determined based on comparison to a set of null models generated by random permutations of the response; the same permutation-based approach is used to evaluate the significance of individual features. In the analysis of large and complex biological datasets, such as transcriptomic and proteomic data, eNetXplorer provides summary statistics, output tables, and visualizations to help assess which subset(s) of features have predictive value for a set of response measurements, and to what extent those subset(s) of features can be expanded or reduced via regularization. Conclusions This package presents a framework and software for exploratory data analysis and visualization. By making regularized GLMs more accessible and interpretable, eNetXplorer guides the process to generate hypotheses based on features significantly associated with biological phenotypes of interest, e.g. to identify biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness. eNetXplorer is also generally applicable to any research area that may benefit from predictive modeling and feature identification using regularized GLMs. Availability and implementation The package is available under GPL-3 license at the CRAN repository, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eNetXplorer",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""JuliÃ¡n Candia"", ids = ""2228160""); list(name = ""John S.

The present work aimed to screen tumor microenvironment-related genes strongly related to prognosis and to construct a prognostic gene expression model for HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We downloaded gene expression data of 371 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A novel ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to calculate immune scores and stromal scores for each patient. Then, the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were detected according to the immune and stromal scores, and tumor microenvironment-related genes were further explored. Univariate, Lasso, and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to build the tumor microenvironment-related prediction model. RESULTS Stromal and immune scores were calculated and were found to be correlated with the 3-year prognosis of HCC patients. DEGs were detected according to the stromal and immune scores. There were 49 genes with prognostic value in both TCGA and ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) considered as prognostic tumor microenvironment-related genes. Univariate, Lasso, and multivariate Cox analyses were conducted. A novel 2-gene signature (IL18RAP and GPR182) was built for HCC 3-year prognosis prediction. The 2-gene signature was regarded as an independent prognostic predictor that was correlated with 3-year survival rate, as shown by Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS This study offers a novel 2-gene signature to predict overall survival of patients with HCC, which has the potential to be used as an independent prognostic predictor. Overall, this study reveals more details about the tumor microenvironment in HCC and offers novel candidate biomarkers.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zongbiao Tian"", ids = ""98822395""); list(name = ""Zheng Wang"", ids = ""12229887""); list(name = ""Yan-feng Chen"", ids = ""21847090""); list(name = ""Shuoying Qu"", ids = ""1605143806""); list(name = ""Changhong Liu"", ids = ""2332685""); list(name = ""Fengzhe Chen"", ids = ""4672932""); list(name = ""Lixian Ma"", ids = ""3922774""); list(name = ""Jie Zhu"", ids = ""24745524"")",,eddf8f24d5bc2fa3b87361bd4f298fb985edb885; 673ad32108d34d259c9be78982b5011ffa814f0b; d3035fb3eb7d031adb86148a38a5b9e797b816d6; 7037e0f794138928a7087c117443ee7e4900292f; 2f3c851447d3b6e2810fc4931fc23bdbefd57521; 6000c3b087ef51a8b93a463fe3fa6eaed6501c15; 3f56eaaf5e9f0acc09ed7591dd04393f6c2fd26b; e801730957fe4e0902bd5d802c0406106ebb0d91; 72e43fdd00f79b3a917204c3295da2c7435a1cfd; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 4601072a77d230bdda0c07148679cf419a77e149; f8a07ff060b97254f92843c746cd02b40b7efe9b; df8ecef4c1ad06f672b45022241fae499e832d44; f7b3c66b1189901eb84694c8cd0fcc4f0f43c392; a60015b269829c7f79eae51601f772da0eae64fd; f5f41348dd9bf2901b3cd8d1e9cb7a7a0c6e1600; 282950d8fd6fbee7b80421ff48c5d20c7af9925f; 65fb81619ddc1369a87dd8c2dd228995b0ead935; e5a3b0c5aaf501b2aff0070f4f7ed9979121a84d; b6dabbfedd0affd953ab0e208d829be8b94a2a85; df76d675d6c947e483cd5225283a0ffa2b198399; 57812912f761e590f75b7b1eacc2a856bc6c8bd3; 6859dd8de1688b09b3c23b0c893c3b89bad9abc3; 99649284503c2abe6871ae45f3dbf394a3a86352; 283f3957ef89b51d146c9213211939de00eb66a4; 58960e18b1b81c5466d2cdf1d5ab33adc8957681; 841bd3219dcf90fab8ba3781156cf14da95aac06; 003ae50ddf67dda7fdcf2e67a56d13514259516f; d11b02f5055ea6c57d78ebfe58b7ba894d4384f2; 4d19b08c62cbffcea1c4d30e34c5a20070e8c34e; 8b9a0919bc2107e75327a46ec90487fbe3ce9d41; f4b7cd784ee02a0de77565d0807a1389cc224fdf; 09b0efeebf38a38f9bfa6e9bd10f13de60df06ac; 63d1fbd8fc3d6a4f33eae387e97117e80154a3f7; 62d09117dd02f3184b58916fd9a26fd314a6c0fa; abe2e8b416434714f9f3013577ce478955ad1183; 5845331f69a8bf43832ee5fe58848ea4019948a0; ddec735467f9676a77b7bd5570bbb0a3746569ce,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research,26,e922159-1 - e922159-12

We therefore suggest to pursue a different goal, which we call a minimal class of models. The minimal class of models includes models that are similar in their prediction accuracy but not necessarily in their elements. We suggest a random search algorithm to reveal candidate models. The algorithm implements simulated annealing while using a score for each predictor that we suggest to derive using a combination of the Lasso and the Elastic Net.

de6ba16ee8ad07e2f02d685b1e98b8be5045cb1b,Adaptive discriminant learning for face recognition,"Face recognition from Single Sample per Person (SSPP) is extremely challenging because only one sample is available for each person. While many discriminant analysis methods, such as Fisherfaces and its numerous variants, have achieved great success in face recognition, these methods cannot work in this scenario, because more than one sample per person are needed to calculate the within-class scatter matrix. To address this problem, we propose Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (ADA) in which the within-class scatter matrix of each enrolled subject is inferred using his/her single sample, by leveraging a generic set with multiple samples per person. Our method is motivated from the assumption that subjects who look alike to each other generally share similar within-class variations. In ADA, a limited number of neighbors for each single sample are first determined from the generic set by using kNN regression or Lasso regression. Then, the within-class scatter matrix of this single sample is inferred as the weighted average of the within-class scatter matrices of these neighbors based on the arithmetic mean or Riemannian mean. Finally, the optimal ADA projection directions can be computed analytically by using the inferred within-class scatter matrices and the actual between-class scatter matrix. The proposed method is evaluated on three databases including FERET database, FRGC database and a large real-world passport-like face database. The extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ADA when compared with the existing solutions to the SSPP problem.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Meina Kan"", ids = ""1693589""); list(name = ""Shiguang Shan"", ids = ""145455919""); list(name = ""Yu Su"", ids = ""145244892""); list(name = ""Dong Xu"", ids = ""38188040""); list(name = ""Xilin Chen"", ids = ""1710220"")",2de4462d249cb099ecaeb8b37bc51fa9abecf86a; 048ce5d48a4f2622db558d049363c8428536dcdd; ada4901e0022b4fdeb9ec3ae26b986199f7ae3be; 61a3c45c9f802f9d5fa8d94fee811e203bac6487; 705a61f5e2d31a2382f3f07d1669755284d8407d; d578fb228576e06ad57a2163d48f43b6a60aa663; a1e82209738c57206064d131f883ec516a7f14b5; 5cd3bcc5c70b12754edc1001457d2466100f3f14; 8d5ea0c79eecc9e6c857eac5d494d57960e0f587; 6cebfe75fc0b4278e9ae396b1033c49bf1d39cc0; dae7020cde22cd6b5ed1bd9149c513aa196a6e60; c69916375fec3c3ebba3aafb31c99a2beb0151c4; d20fe35b40108a5b7e27ac2363171f83be25c5a9; f732ff3e718ae0f86c5d8cf66b30a18878762863; c7fad91ba4e33f64d584c928b1200327815f09e6; 7b2036c039069a09b481b70f474f537ee07340e5; 6a3ec8a8904436020fac8ce7873c0f47abfac17c; a12e81803c91dc9392b8ea5201124942e77d0fb2; 61f0aeb806aa4f872367dce0bad192ebf561a4f7; 57de1a09db680e0b4878ceda68d626ae4e44ccfe; ec40df721a80c62d4a768fe29b58d86b1a07f435; 1da5fc63d66fbf750b0e15c5ef6d4274ca73cca1; 00e654540323758fa2676f699359c9ef94985b2e; 029aaad7855f21c567416a6fdcb5a40448d6ed6c; 4906cb9954509ea18c557afae04cef6c131a87b3; ad44090513b15b313ce97378c952aba65dc60822; 8e71a8352a373697bca904e69dd728317d55917c; e089462ee3d91074402f25eb45bcf961da9ee2cb; 7b47dd9302b3085cd6705614b88d7bdbc8ae5c13; 7aebc9bc78114eb811cdb625d76964dd955b2be3; 015f5b76fcb91c64983e5b86e3b9b99d8ee98917; 20830f958fa822fe8f0fb8aecd2a2655e595438a; 21959bc56a160ebd450606867dce1462a913afab; 7acbc7edfeee7c3a19b6f204e1c290172150db5c; f7c155f9bfb55ecd7518feb7cc8854aee36b43ed; f6dabb4d91bf7389f3af219d486d4e67cec18c17; 64da1bfef7db423f31ff92713fbbe1994ad4124d; 97bb7c4c8d77e11030fb9e75f87d0bddc2f43962; dcb99b0de664e17b1de205dd1aad327414ea686e; cd7a49bb322c35a16609284883b133b91b85fbd0; 84187adc5e6412123405102bb3c2f0428713593c; 14e949f5754f9e5160e8bfa3f1364dd92c2bb8d6,283371bb21aaddf92ea975869a69b3b1aad8a4db; bf4c1819546ec255d3997c8f5f9674282370e6eb; 33e46a618fdb22d46951f548d6ceeb384e7f1687; 002972e45009168d63b024b04168f92554b9e248; a55428db30ce6f4d8d6bc6fed4caa58daf550353; 6caaa0f5cf70a63e30b4b3181caeb0fb9f5b6c79; a6f1dfcc44277d4cfd8507284d994c9283dc3a2f; 3db404d21edae047b45b6c9935e052ecaf1cbd46; 279538cc476114a415a96d5889e01f26a4a9a00a; 2a4511b5d5e2ae730622c20322ddaf29f9077461; 0f00a04c4a8c92e070b50ab411df4cd31d2cbe97; 86d2bb930fd4fec5fbeff69d1990007f786b7959; 3f600e6c6cf93e78c9e6e690443d6d22c4bf18b9; f8763a14e2b3c0658441d47008b4bb100f28cd90; e3f76c5282af19f3a8465373463a72845cfa434a; b939034fb810c2bc9061da4b75cc62e862826261; 2da90f15baf1c8ca282331b53ddeea4c2ef2f88c; ac7c8d7b696e855bb0af8c5105a7b1ff0f3731cb; 3f4b8fe5edfac918c1c74317242b2d91346d5fb6; f4cb568fa8bbab1afcc87b62538f6052c770a660; afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65; 66505cb708b098a93331471f079965f6ded4ea7f; a40cf9fb490c2eacdc2d26a5182120f0f1766b47; 776f6d45b38cf048ff30cea41f0cd3ceeefed622; ac6f23544161c723567812f96a4cd71ed47041fc; fb40746127921b81bcedfd49b8f9bdf5ba71e631; b62628ac06bbac998a3ab825324a41a11bc3a988; 9ca42780672df27d0e67a6346598525d61303105; ed2ad7dfdb82039f63908b20dd736a92b6fdf3d5; a7500aabf0a749d0cb9a51b8622a39f5afa23377; 2f8036339f4aa6e6e3dad827b55a3316a05e1050; 5e23c634a7beb02a127ecb11551fd0333491c602; 75f14ff900ea5bfc11d601109298c6977f941483; fac5a9a18157962cff38df6d4ae69f8a7da1cfa8; 75cedebe0437efc9cdcc430642e2c48cdd459afc; f595b8344201f48a047024456260a3a06525e747; 3c522c9707eb795e0dba69202f1ec946a9072661; d8bf32e0936bae857cbca669f3ebf21455cf9d10; 696ba37d65942ff2522846ff51055bc78b903cc1; c67aeae798dfb8da3a94aff6c02a9b88314fcad3; f9023169508e171e017eeea1f5e7a0f295c93754; 6c2124037cafa3b8733f531abd3ac78b67e0511c; 239beb3861ceceb4c7c7f229234d97198d5c7697; f70bb4aea25c903bf5775670eacd7fb4a19f1395; 210d58b2cdaf856764bff3319ff6bc0e8d72b54e; dc8b25e35a3acb812beb499844734081722319b4; 80db408970c1b8d4ebb664ac313bf5c452f95671; 843752094e3fd1c210737c5d55d641199b511ecc; d3f945e0f14cf069d8a3f97497e94044f5d3b21a; 0d25e5e421a6b7da4016fafded07d44ac4411bae; 8acfef0eb76fe38515f1cb742bd0fec8947058b0; 28312c3a47c1be3a67365700744d3d6665b86f22,Pattern Recognit.,46,2497-2509
1f9a898c1670b7dca84237f44bffe2873733a1b1,Empirical Performance of Cross-Validation With Oracle Methods in a Genomics Context.,"When employing model selection methods with oracle properties such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold cross-validation, for example, m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso.

078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de,High Dimensional Variable Selection.,"This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions.",2009,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Larry A.

7a2af6871286b7e31162a088c4122c49043bfd65,Least squares after model selection in high-dimensional sparse models,"In this paper we study post-model selection estimators which apply ordinary least squares (ols) to the model selected by first-step penalized estimators, typically lasso. It is well known that lasso can estimate the non-parametric regression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve upon. We show that ols post lasso estimator performs at least as well as lasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller bias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the lasso-based model selection â€œfailsâ€ in the sense of missing some components of the â€œtrueâ€ regression model. By the â€œtrueâ€ model we mean here the best s-dimensional approximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle. Furthermore, ols post lasso estimator can perform strictly better than lasso, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the lasso-based model selection correctly includes all components of the â€œtrueâ€ model as a subset and also achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when lasso perfectly selects the â€œtrueâ€ model, the ols post lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by lasso which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the â€œtrueâ€ model. Our rate results are non-asymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the lasso estimator acting as selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example various forms of thresholded lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces maximal sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness-of-fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of lasso or ols post lasso, but it dominates these procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments.

The latest data on major attacks against civilian aid operations have identified South Sudan as the most dangerous country for aid workers globally. Exposure to other traumatic events and chronic stress is also common in this population. No research exists on the mental health of humanitarian workers in South Sudan.


OBJECTIVES
This study examined symptom burden and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol consumption, and burnout among humanitarian workers in South Sudan.


METHOD
We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference.


RESULTS
A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), emotional exhaustion (p < .01), and depersonalization (p < .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p < .01).


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that humanitarian workers in South Sudan experience substantial levels of mental ill-health.

aafdc3c0948f62d4c63569cf95afee65f6d118a8,Influential factors in crude oil price forecasting,"Abstract This paper identifies factors that are influential in forecasting crude oil prices. We consider six categories of factors (supply, demand, financial market, commodities market, speculative, and geopolitical) and test their significance in the context of estimating various forecasting models. We find that the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method provides significant improvements in the forecasting accuracy of prices compared to alternative benchmarks. Relative to the no-change and futures-based models, LASSO forecasts at the 8-step ahead horizon yield significant reductions in Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE), with MSPE ratios of 0.873 and 0.898, respectively. We also document substantial improvements in forecasting performance of the factor-based model that employs only a subset of variables chosen by LASSO. Finally, the time-varying nature of the relationship between factors and oil prices is used to explain recent movements in crude oil prices.",2017,Economics,"list(name = ""Hong Bin Miao"", ids = ""98518874""); list(name = ""Sanjay Ramchander"", ids = ""15080358""); list(name = ""Tianyang Wang"", ids = ""48469758""); list(name = ""Dongxiao Yang"", ids = ""49262890"")",0cfb2f9165d74879e51325641b2b9921ffa8e745; bc1cb15b39e271c9dbafae2130a37a50d41670ea; 72232a22d4c4dd3db6f5ed78c3597ee08c646bf1; ca64d8715edd8fe6cda6e0a9f468c6b7e81970ea; 29f171b5bdb79aae371c8be57a602f6d4a838210; 0635cc12338c25957b67794a276853953d38664b; 149a1bf41b5742e7a618e7f0619dd67461e2c269; f49c7e410887ccd0e591cee065f738c2e6ceb077,,Energy Economics,68,77-88
3bf7448da95f546096458ec4b9092ecdf93124fd,Prediction of mortality risk in victims of violent crimes.,"BACKGROUND
To predict mortality risk in victims of violent crimes based on individual injury diagnoses and other information available in health care registries.


METHODS
Data from the Swedish hospital discharge registry and the cause of death registry were combined to identify 15,000 hospitalisations or prehospital deaths related to violent crimes. The ability of patient characteristics, injury type and severity, and cause of injury to predict death was modelled using conventional, Lasso, or Bayesian logistic regression in a development dataset and evaluated in a validation dataset.


RESULTS
Of 14,470 injury events severe enough to cause death or hospitalization 3.7% (556) died before hospital admission and 0.5% (71) during the hospital stay. The majority (76%) of hospital survivors had minor injury severity and most (67%) were discharged from hospital within 1day. A multivariable model with age, sex, the ICD-10 based injury severity score (ICISS), cause of injury, and major injury region provided predictions with very good discrimination (C-index=0.99) and calibration. Adding information on major injury interactions further improved model performance. Modeling individual injury diagnoses did not improve predictions over the combined ICISS score.


CONCLUSIONS
Mortality risk after violent crimes can be accurately estimated using administrative data. The use of Bayesian regression models provides meaningful risk assessment with more straightforward interpretation of uncertainty of the prediction, potentially also on the individual level. This can aid estimation of incidence trends over time and comparisons of outcome of violent crimes for injury surveillance and in forensic medicine.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rolf Gedeborg"", ids = ""6417679""); list(name = ""Bodil Svennblad"", ids = ""6250777""); list(name = ""L Byberg"", ids = ""145536290""); list(name = ""Karl MichaÃ«lsson"", ids = ""3676454""); list(name = ""Ingemar Thiblin"", ids = ""6326489"")",e47e2b59be9988ffa235b202d258209213565807; bec33038e537bdd4933438fbabc1555ce4a5e4e4,,Forensic science international,281,"

22e63789cfef15d732edb6a0d25014685426334e,A plasma metabolite panel as biomarkers for early primary breast cancer detection.,"In recent years, metabolites have attracted substantial attention as promising novel biomarkers of various diseases. However, breast cancer plasma metabolite studies are still in their infancy. Here, we investigated the potential of metabolites to serve as minimally invasive, early detection markers of primary breast cancer. We profiled metabolites extracted from the plasma of primary breast cancer patients and healthy controls using tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS). Two metabolites were found to be upregulated, while 16 metabolites were downregulated in primary breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls in both the training and validation cohorts. A panel of seven metabolites was selected by LASSO regression analysis. This panel could differentiate primary breast cancer patients from healthy controls, with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81â€‰~â€‰0.92) in the training cohort and an AUC ofâ€‰0.80 (95% CI: 0.71â€‰~â€‰0.87) in the validation cohort. These significantly differentiated metabolites are mainly involved in the amino acid metabolism and breast cancer cell growth pathways. In conclusion, using a metabolomics approach, we identified metabolites that have potential value for development of a multimarker blood-based test to complement and improve early breast cancer detection. The panel identified herein might be part of a prescreening tool, especially for younger women or for closely observing women with certain risks, to facilitate decision making regarding which individuals should undergo further diagnostic tests. In the future, the combination of metabolites and other blood-based molecular marker sets, such as DNA methylation, microRNA, and cell-free DNA mutation markers, will be an attractive option.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Baowen Yuan"", ids = ""113242457""); list(name = ""Simon Schafferer"", ids = ""6031577""); list(name = ""Qiuqiong Tang"", ids = ""50775425""); list(name = ""Matthias Scheffler"", ids = ""145310711""); list(name = ""Juliane Nees"", ids = ""46444527""); list(name = ""Joerg Heil"", ids = ""2300035""); list(name = ""Sarah Schott"", ids = ""144586736""); list(name = ""Michael Golatta"", ids = ""5387406""); list(name = ""Markus Wallwiener"", ids = ""5876867""); list(name = ""Christof Sohn"", ids = ""143984453""); list(name = ""Therese Koal"", ids = ""4728512""); list(name = ""Barbara Wolf"", ids = ""87304031""); list(name = ""Andreas Schneeweiss"", ids = ""98690586""); list(name = ""Barbara Burwinkel"", ids = ""5649032"")",513f27de1dd41411cd174190aa30fb35db188b34; b58d2243dda2717e0a425ced12c3fc989da63ccd; 8c7c7a90026b6b6f662d81bd9c65b3dc63659c38; c42d74fbafe5db128ed40a24135d77c7260f5faa; accda81c921cc609a7f023098685bca0e217c723; f7f853ae22bd20d585a0aa6d4502affb00fd8b1a,,International journal of cancer,144 11,"

931d7a3cd8a74a8d1e51315cdf90ac05b309d6a4,On the Oracle Property of the Adaptive Lasso in Stationary and Nonstationary Autoregressions,"We show that the Adaptive LASSO is oracle efficient in stationary and non-stationary autoregressions. This means that it estimates parameters consistently, selects the correct sparsity pattern, and estimates the coefficients belonging to the relevant variables at the same asymptotic efficiency as if only these had been included in the model from the outset. In particular this implies that it is able to discriminate between stationary and non-stationary autoregressions and it thereby constitutes an addition to the set of unit root tests. However, it is also shown that the Adaptive LASSO has no power against shrinking alternatives of the form c/T where c is a constant and T the sample size if it is tuned to perform consistent model selection. We show that if the Adaptive LASSO is tuned to performed conservative model selection it has power even against shrinking alternatives of this form. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the Adaptive LASSO performs particularly well in the presence of a unit root while being at par with its competitors in the stationary setting.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anders Bredahl Kock"", ids = ""34599923"")",7194546243d0377cadf58cca41ceea559ed2f022; cf56a4bcf05a3da3dd4fbeda098bbb35a81c9288; 52c0f14c7a0d295cf44928eac7179ac6f30e2092; c3c53005dc07744bd2c8a41acf468d7b4bda9c67; fcba6cab523024a4540c5a2c42d9ec73bb15c62f; 5949d2e31ded3df217b6e2829a8520d031416623; 3974652733db583c68baa0046afe29bd3a919cb8,6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; adc27ff8cb1d6ec976de226af75e296866565c4e; 1ba843ad1c318113a78f6e66af22c4c99eb52937; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; a4527adde7e91a87b8d7c7cbecc673d088709b86; ba56155267c29d1b540e089df044db8f22c55a9a; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; e28ba0fd6ea94bd56f277d3a89de8f47fd5d1943; 5962e8f838c548ca16cfb8f22d4e2e7ffc77c6f7; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 2ae80174da7fc699e851be2a538932b8cb0057e8,,,

For example, in combination with RGB-D cameras, a patient surface model can be used to automate and accelerate the diagnostic imaging workflow, manage patient dose, and provide navigation assistance. A shortcoming of todayâ€™s patient surface models, however, is that, internal anatomical landmarks are not present. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate internal anatomical landmarks based on the surface model of a patient. Our method relies on two major steps. First, we fit a template surface model is to a segmented surface of a CT dataset with annotated internal landmarks using keypoint and feature descriptor based rigid alignment and atlas-based non-rigid registration. In a second step, we find for each internal landmark a neighborhood on the template surface and learn a generalized linear embedding between neighboring surface vertices in the template and the internal landmark. We trained and evaluated our method using cross-validation in 20 datasets over 50 internal landmarks. We compared the performance of four different generalized linear models. The best mean estimation error over all the landmarks was achieved using the lasso regression method with a mean error of 12.19 Â± 6.98 mm.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xia Zhong"", ids = ""40596388""); list(name = ""Norbert Strobel"", ids = ""145696213""); list(name = ""Annette Birkhold"", ids = ""5958175""); list(name = ""Markus Kowarschik"", ids = ""2761725""); list(name = ""Rebecca Fahrig"", ids = ""10193743""); list(name = ""Andreas K.

4e84ed439d38a0e916e028281590f9586193ad06,Large Vector Auto Regressions,"One popular approach for nonstructural economic and financial forecasting is to include a large number of economic and financial variables, which has been shown to lead to significant improvements for forecasting, for example, by the dynamic factor models. A challenging issue is to determine which variables and (their) lags are relevant, especially when there is a mixture of serial correlation (temporal dynamics), high dimensional (spatial) dependence structure and moderate sample size (relative to dimensionality and lags). To this end, an integrated solution that addresses these three challenges simultaneously is appealing. We study the large vector auto regressions here with three types of estimates. We treat each variable's own lags different from other variables' lags, distinguish various lags over time, and is able to select the variables and lags simultaneously. We first show the consequences of using Lasso type estimate directly for time series without considering the temporal dependence. In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an estimate as efficient as an oracle under such scenarios. The tuning parameters are chosen via a data driven ""rolling scheme"" method to optimize the forecasting performance.
