c599666d8935f4b7a596f1b89a388c0391b13a76,Hierarchical Total Variations and Doubly Penalized ANOVA Modeling for Multivariate Nonparametric Regression,"For multivariate nonparametric regression, functional analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) modeling aims to capture the relationship between a response and covariates by decomposing the unknown function into various components, representing main effects, two-way interactions, etc. Such an approach has been pursued explicitly in smoothing spline ANOVA modeling and implicitly in various greedy methods such as MARS. We develop a new method for functional ANOVA modeling, based on doubly penalized estimation using total-variation and empirical-norm penalties, to achieve sparse selection of component functions and their knots. For this purpose, we formulate a new class of hierarchical total variations, which measures total variations at different levels including main effects and multi-way interactions, possibly after some order of differentiation. Furthermore, we derive suitable basis functions for multivariate splines such that the hierarchical total variation can be represented as a regular Lasso penalty, and hence we extend a previous backfitting algorithm to handle doubly penalized estimation for ANOVA modeling. We present extensive numerical experiments on simulations and real data to compare our method with existing methods including MARS, tree boosting, and random forest. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate considerable gains from our method in both prediction or classification accuracy and simplicity of the fitted functions.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tianshui Yang"", ids = ""3535916""); list(name = ""Zhiqiang Tan"", ids = ""143939133"")",,97158ebc9b04de539005e1f5966c3d56f59211a4; 5acfb2abca580a40f2f6890371c2387527dfefc0; a561e7722094ae1dfc4c9425622ca45ed3684e02; f25f09e670fa860a5ec230ddca8600bb46093234; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; c42d04eba814b98818f57e5cb1609f68be7126d4; 0916556e1e17b668dbe4940f8b1feddc5f475a37; 0c9a37c546efaee637b8ce510dd748860a472026; 9c980c5477c1f1a369a19dd954c936185bbd8b82; efda42d821605707c89aebc3912da4748f3d02ce; b7160d496c06316a1abdeb49af232a6b5abd500b; 54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9; 455c7dacdc1c3260649bf062ca6f2764c33019ad; d3201762486b88bbd6fa7a8c62a96ea69f76923f; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; dc070f1f11ae5769980e2359c5a8f35ebf2b9e04; 5d8b7fbe0e5fe0a6913b5d3213872c50c98023b2; 923d503312cd7d7093dd7e9d1d19f36df81c7c0a; c562a2479094768fcf76bcc992cdbf12227a98fe; 64ec4b972a2b0321b768b56c5a4ffa44d0e8c72b; db31973871f5648cffb02e7590582376e16ad0bb; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; a966783349c09ff532cd31b14a3a155c85f6c284; 24682c83202421287c3dd8b7b5769825b9fb35c1; 882e47ecab26ab9227a21131ae22e15c62af68ed; e582469e3eed0bcb5c458ff5fd200f5acdbe0d33; 9704e1a4dbc9cd54971da2079e4f0a477c0df045; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,arXiv: Methodology,,
f7666f313e3c730f1e301132c8a6162b08b91af1,Learning Some Popular Gaussian Graphical Models without Condition Number Bounds,"Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) have wide-ranging applications in machine learning and the natural and social sciences. In most of the settings in which they are applied, the number of observed samples is much smaller than the dimension and they are assumed to be sparse. While there are a variety of algorithms (e.g. Graphical Lasso, CLIME) that provably recover the graph structure with a logarithmic number of samples, they assume various conditions that require the precision matrix to be in some sense well-conditioned. 
Here we give the first polynomial-time algorithms for learning attractive GGMs and walk-summable GGMs with a logarithmic number of samples without any such assumptions. In particular, our algorithms can tolerate strong dependencies among the variables. Our result for structure recovery in walk-summable GGMs is derived from a more general result for efficient sparse linear regression in walk-summable models without any norm dependencies. We complement our results with experiments showing that many existing algorithms fail even in some simple settings where there are long dependency chains, whereas ours do not.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jonathan A.

0c9a37c546efaee637b8ce510dd748860a472026,Adaptive piecewise polynomial estimation via trend filtering,"We study trend filtering, a recently proposed tool of Kim et al. [SIAM Rev. 51 (2009) 339-360] for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute $k$th order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of $k$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413], which penalize the total variation of the $k$th derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose $k$th derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ryan J.

dcea11dcd11e0fe36300438be2f3a81e4eb6328b,Bayesian and LASSO Regressions for Comparative Permeability Modeling of Sandstone Reservoirs,"In this research, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) algorithms were adopted for the core permeability modeling as a function of well log and core measurements. More specifically, the core permeability (dependent factor) was modeled given the well log and core data (independent variables) and then predicted in non-cored intervals of a well in a sandstone formation. The BMA is a stochastic linear modeling and a Bayesian parameter selection. Among 50 linear models generated as a function of the independent variables and depicted in Occamâ€™s window, the best model of the highest posterior probability is determined. The best model has the optimal subset parameters that most influences the response factor. The core permeability modeling was again conducted using the LASSO algorithm, which adopts a completely different way of modeling and subset selection by using the penalized least-squared equation. Both BMA and LASSO resulted in a very accurate prediction of the core permeability by achieving perfect measured and calculated permeability matching. Matches for the two algorithms were quantified by computing the adjusted R-squared and root-mean-squared prediction error. In addition, results of the BMA and LASSO were compared to the conventional multiple linear regression (LM). The LASSO algorithm led to an accurate matching similar to LM, but slightly better than BMA. Therefore, both BMA and LASSO represent integrated procedures for accurate permeability estimation similar to conventional regression analysis.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Watheq J.

f3b86d52b29fe4241ff248a87c4497d1e750ef7e,Prediction of risk scores for colorectal cancer patients from the concentration of proteins involved in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway,"One of the major challenges in managing the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is to predict risk scores or level of risk for CRC patients. In past, several biomarkers, based on concentration of proteins involved in type-2/intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, have been identified for prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Recently, a prognostic tool DR MOMP has been developed that can discriminate high and low risk CRC patients with reasonably high accuracy (Hazard Ratio, HR = 5.24 and p-value = 0.0031). This prognostic tool showed an accuracy of 59.7% when used to predict favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes. In this study, we developed knowledge based models for predicting risk scores of CRC patients. Models were trained and evaluated on 134 stage III CRC patients. Firstly, we developed multiple linear regression based models using different techniques and achieved a maximum HR value of 6.34 with p-value = 0.0032 for a model developed using LassoLars technique. Secondly, models were developed using a parameter optimization technique and achieved a maximum HR value of 38.13 with p-value 0.0006. We also predicted favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes and achieved maximum prediction accuracy value of 71.64%. The performance of our models were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. For providing service to the community we also developed a web server â€˜CRCRpredâ€™, to predict risk scores of CRC patients, which is freely available at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/crcrpred.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Anjali Lathwal"", ids = ""146111978""); list(name = ""Chakit Arora"", ids = ""90264284""); list(name = ""Gajendra P.S.

Generalizing the idea of the Lasso, we consider the problem of estimating the coefficients by minimizing the sum of squares with the constraint that the coefficients belong to a closed convex set. Based on a differential geometric approach, we derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom for this estimation method, under a smoothness assumption on the boundary of the closed convex set. The result presented in this paper is applicable to estimation with a wide class of constraints.

b6fea0bcae69fadb94148787a8515b14ef21e4b0,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma: can we successfully step into the era of precision medicine?,"Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a relatively rare but highly aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), most of which have T-cell origin (T-LBL) [1]. Due to the rarity of T-LBL, no well-designed prospective clinical trials have been conducted to establish the optimal treatment regimens. It is generally recognized that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like intensive chemotherapies can acheive more favorable prognosis in T-LBL than NHL-like regimens [1â€“3]. Though the prognosis of pediatric T-LBL has been improved significantly, unmet clinical needs exist in the treatment of adult T-LBL [2]. Although ALL-like intensive induction chemotherapies could induce high remission rate, the relapse rate remains high (40â€“50%). Currently, intensive consolidation chemotherapies followed by maintenance treatment or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are used to reduce the relapse rate although the role of HSCT consolidation has not been defined [1]. In addition, no reliable prognostic factors have been defined in adult T-LBL as in T-ALL [4]. Commonly used risk factors, such as bone marrow and central nervous system involvement, advanced stage, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level showed prognostic value [5] which is yet to be validated in the era of ALL-like treatment. Recently the GRAALL-LYSA LL03 study has proposed a four-gene oncogenetic classifier (NOTCH1/ FBXW7/RAS/PTEN) [6]. Cortelazzo et al. suggested that minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow, based on analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in a small number (n = 11) of patients, was a useful index to assign adult patients with T-LBL to HSCT [7]. MRD monitoring may be combined with PET-CT scan for selection of HSCT and maintenance therapy. However, several studies found that PET-CT findings did not predict clinical outcome in T-LBL [6, 8], and the incidence of false-positive PET-CT scan for mediastinum lesions can be high [9]. Thus, it is critical to develop a reliable prognostic model to both predict outcomes of ALL-like treatment and facilitate precision medicine for choice of HSCT in T-LBL. In a study recently published in Leukemia [10], titled â€œPrognostic and predictive value of a microRNA signature in adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomaâ€, Tian et al. developed a five-miRNA-based classifier in a largest-ever cohort of T-LBL, and validated it to be a valuable biomarker to identify patients who could benefit from HSCT in first complete remission (CR1). In this multicenter study, 517 patients with T-LBL treated with ALL-like regimens were included, and all patients achieved CR1 after relatively uniform treatments (365 patients were treated according to BFM protocol and 152 patients according to hyperCVAD protocol). Using microarray, 35 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between 75 T-LBL tissue samples and 20 fetal thymus tissues, which were further analyzed for 213 T-LBL patients using qRT-PCR. A five-miRNA-based classifier, a risk estimator based on expression status of five miRNAs (including miR-21-5p, miR-513a-5p, miR-19b3p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-638) and their LASSO Cox regression coefficents in the training set, was constructed and validated to be an independent prognostic factor at diagnosis for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 213 T-LBL and the entire cohort (DFS: hazard ratio [HR] 3.427, 95% CI 2.586â€“4.540, p < 0.001; OS: HR 3.142, 95% CI 2.332â€“4.234, p < 0.001). HSCT was given to 145 patients at CR1 at the discretion of their treating physicians. No benefit of HSCT consolidation was shown in the entire cohort. Moreover, HSCT did not show benefit in high-risk patients according to clinical or genetic * Ken H. Young ken.young@duke.edu",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ken H.

303de4723690048cdaaa48465a377515a2634a5d,A nested case-control study of 277 prediagnostic serum cytokines and glioma,"Recent research shows bidirectional communication between the normal brain and the peripheral immune system. Glioma is a primary brain tumor characterized by systemic immunosuppression. To better understand gliomagenesis, we evaluated associations between 277 prediagnostic serum cytokines and glioma. We used glioma (n = 487) and matched control (n = 487) specimens from the Janus Serum Bank Cohort in Oslo, Norway. Conditional logistic regression allowed us to identify those cytokines that were individually associated with glioma. Next, we used heat maps to compare case to control Pearson correlation matrices of 12 cytokines modeled in an in silico study of the interaction between the microenvironment and the tumor. We did the same for case-control correlation matrices of lasso-selected cytokines and all 277 cytokines in the data set. Cytokines related to glioma risk (P â‰¤ .05) more than 10 years before diagnosis are sIL10RB, VEGF, beta-Catenin and CCL22. LIF was associated with decreased glioma risk within five years before glioma diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23, 0.94). After adjustment for cytokines above, the previously observed interaction between IL4 and sIL4RA persisted (> 20 years before diagnosis, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.47). In addition, during this period, case correlations among 12 cytokines were weaker than were those among controls. This pattern was also observed among 30 lasso- selected cytokines and all 277 cytokines. We identified four cytokines and one interaction term that were independently related to glioma risk. We have documented prediagnostic changes in serum cytokine levels that may reflect the presence of a preclinical tumor.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Judith Schwartzbaum"", ids = ""5757274""); list(name = ""Min Wang"", ids = ""50468621""); list(name = ""Elisabeth Dowling Root"", ids = ""1922620""); list(name = ""Maciej Pietrzak"", ids = ""3776471""); list(name = ""Grzegorz A.

Many of procedures in use are ad hoc stepwise selection procedures, which are computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process of previous steps. An automatic and simultaneous variable selection procedure can be obtained by using a penalized likelihood method. In traditional linear models, the best subset selection and stepwise deletion methods coincide with a penalized least- squares method when design matrices are orthonormal. In this paper, we propose a few new approaches to selecting variables for linear models, robust regression models and generalized linear models based on a penalized likelihood approach. A family of thresholding functions are proposed. The LASSO proposed by Tibshirani (1996) is a member of the penalized least- squares with the Li-penalty. A smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty function is introduced to ameliorate the properties of Li-penalty. A unified algorithm is introduced, which is backed up by statistical theory. The new approaches are compared with the ordinary least- squares methods, the garrote method by Breiman (1995) and the LASSO method by Tibshirani (1996). Our simulation results show that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other approaches as an automatic variable selection technique. Because of simultaneous selection of variables and estimation of parameters, we are able to give a simple estimated standard error formula, which is tested to be accurate enough for practical applications. Two real data examples illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. K e y Words: Hard thresholding, LASSO, nonnegative garrote, SCAD, soft thresholding.

c0fc3882a9976f6a9cdc3a724bce184b786503da,A Unified Framework for Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression: SR3,"Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity.

42098cddb474cbc8787aa0df2655e29dc2b8b1cd,Evaluating Effects of Tuition Fees: Lasso for the Case of Germany,"We study the effect of the introduction of university tuition fees on the enrollment behavior of students in Germany. For this, an appropriate Lasso-technique is crucial in order to identify the magnitude and significance of the effect due to potentially many relevant controlling factors and only a short time frame where fees existed. We show that a post-double selection strategy combined with stability selection determines a significant negative impact of fees on student enrollment and identifies relevant variables. This is in contrast to previous empirical studies and a plain linear panel regression which cannot detect any effect of tuition fees in this case. In our study, we explicitly deal with data challenges in the response variable in a transparent way and provide respective robust results. Moreover, we control for spatial cross-effects capturing the heterogeneity in the introduction scheme of fees across federal states (""Bundesl\""ander""), which can set their own educational policy. We also confirm the validity of our Lasso approach in a comprehensive simulation study.",2019,Mathematics; Economics,"list(name = ""Konstantin Gorgen"", ids = ""1382563053""); list(name = ""Melanie Schienle"", ids = ""32087645"")",,d22345d96cfca8cc12b71e93dbf2129365efaefb; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; d64e2a9498ff73c11b1a51b348df8db30df7f416; 21a5b40fa307943fb429f57f8bbfd29b3b736b2a; e00e7347268e1a2dec4fcd02c7daaa1cb6506b96; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; ed070132a85558cc5dcb50d9d817c99f5ba9f52d; cd4c6afaa4746d0067e0d5abf83a148cbc12b76b; dff9333ba050a051cb304134c0a1d9a95c3fa574; 457ffd0d58b120689ee073f81a43baafbd1a69bd; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 50156df7a41c2f2773f18ed951f63bfd4897798f; 5a1cad9f72573cd46a7cb400f05beff51e2ee65a; 5de3ed893d55624f87405c6a1601aeb51c372afc; a87dab66d985980f7c90d0a497cf1a6505e803eb; 985133dc1dbf60f73a2e09156b6428157292c85e; b71a21fca686e9ddf1e61b2300fd99b357d781b9; c33f54b33ed10d0629adccb9d6a2ccd86aba0903; 920120cc842feea3296e4df1019364677c42429a; a3331d9864244aecc801d13eda695b43a8c87363; a128875b55426fec4daa4246fd77a7ee17288f2d,arXiv: Applications,,
055a8d89cff898e298f8a99b6eea2f6329f4e274,Penalized methods and algorithms for high-dimensional regression in the presence of heterogeneity,"In fields such as statistics, economics and biology, heterogeneity is an important topic concerning validity of data inference and discovery of hidden patterns. This thesis focuses on penalized methods for regression analysis with the presence of heterogeneity in a potentially high-dimensional setting. Two possible strategies to deal with heterogeneity are: robust regression methods that provide heterogeneity-resistant coefficient estimation, and direct detection of heterogeneity while estimating coefficients accurately in the meantime. We consider the first strategy for two robust regression methods, Huber loss regression and quantile regression with Lasso or Elastic-Net penalties, which have been studied theoretically but lack efficient algorithms. We propose a new algorithm Semismooth Newton Coordinate Descent to solve them. The algorithm is a novel combination of Semismooth Newton Algorithm and Coordinate Descent that applies to penalized optimization problems with both nonsmooth loss and nonsmooth penalty. We prove its convergence properties, and show its computational efficiency through numerical studies. We also propose a nonconvex penalized regression method, Heterogeneity Discovery Regression (HDR) , as a realization of the second idea. We establish theoretical results that guarantees statistical precision for any local optimum of the objective function with high probability. We also compare the numerical performances of HDR with competitors including Huber loss regression, quantile regression and least squares through simulation studies and a real data example. In these experiments, HDR methods are able to detect heterogeneity accurately, and also largely outperform the competitors in terms of coefficient estimation and variable selection.",2016,Geography,"list(name = ""Congrui Yi"", ids = ""2150986"")",,7a0c4abb8249411a571aa02c37405e5f731341e7; 2a75f9c9fb0df3178d58d1b97cb1416fc12787e7; 363ca7590df5b429c5d16ae95f47de00bbf7161e; 8b2ac86933d7d35e2ff475e63f86ce7fd48db228; 063d400cf20e7003b1d0b347e5895348e79fc302; 1a3eef35df17306ec60180a7214567b3e4dc388e; 07405cd9e1104f62cbb0b7cd9053be08c794a75e; 4ca5a833b8464a1e7ab46d04db6aeb2794eca848; a1b48154af189916082b92b895d9eab863f42629; d1dffca5c54287e7b498eb7469dc04207b24a6fa; c4fda00b0abee9b9a18383fcaa36bdcc19d9e39d; 298781ab074e112bcf10374de6a38fac8e267eec; 3d95ae9504cfb904216be4f2bfda9315d0476986; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 719e65379c5959141180a45f540f707d583b8ce2; 849a2f9fff249cb5c7356aa6b8f4a7c43ce74746; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; b9f6e9ac6c1f07a1875b07791ab08a9d37936f14; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 7b016ec752179e5b59fd197f5d269b39d98596dd; 6a0700327a8f589920c6b79366aa62b11c9c2789; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; ae811bbbd75b62017f1117d0ea8a04835fcb06e3; f95dc8050e55c4b303c62e0527415bccbd940064; 56974187b4d9a8757f4d8a6fd6facc8b4ad08240; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 6677822795fd4aecb2c2cd262f3f3a6cca65295d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d28633983821aa3d886fd6379c52ea78dca51f28; 142ed6d7a4f32ede478d4d617c9f2c26607582cf; 3accd0b572e3267e6b2832c70ac8c4aa92064f5c; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; 75bca8a9ef64a2c5d0c3f33212f087e9dff6d2d1; c09db7439505f49a0958f68e782df94b3807341a; 3f2d42d27f27e4ed1b739c905be454a651cc6af1; a92bac84b79f78c9a0a3fcc53465acfa33425c11; a8de67100d13800aab5729bf15863c9d6bcb90c9; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; 892fd05687f032b93cda33ed9a0b3b8c5435b54f,,,

13e11e9751187de2bf1e71dc800ae68b5d1f8f08,Testing Shape Constraints in Lasso Regularized Joinpoint Regression,"Joinpoint regression models are very popular in some practical areas mainly due to a very simple interpretation which they offer. In some situations, moreover, it turns out to be also useful to require some additional qualitative properties for the final model to be satisfied. Especially properties related to the monotonicity of the fit are of the main interest in this paper. We propose a LASSO regularized approach to estimate these types of models where the optional shape constraints can be implemented in a straightforward way as a set of linear inequalities and they are considered simultaneously within the estimation process itself. As the main result we derive a testing approach which can be effectively used to statistically verify the validity of the imposed shape restrictions in piecewise linear continuous models.

8ee46f7be17cc0aef0fd14be8660b93f9d1a39e7,Computational studies of protein interactions and genetic regulation,"The work in this thesis is split into two parts. The introduction and following two chapters pertain to the investigation of gene regulation using Chip-seq data and linear modelling. The final chapter pertains to the prediction of hot-spot residues in protein-protein interactions. 
 
The rapid escalation in the speed and quality of DNA sequencing has lead to a wealth of data for the location of transcription factor binding and histone modifications across the genomes. Using Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we have generated a new binding metric based on the enrichment of the read-counts for each gene. 
 
Eight datasets from mouse macrophage cells (two histone modifications, five transcription factors, DNase I hypersensitivity) were used to model the binding of RNA polymerase II. It was found that a linear model just using the DNase I hypersensitivity and histone modification data 
was better than any of the models containing the transcription factor data. Investigation of the outlying genes for the model revealed no pattern in their Gene Ontology terms or macrophagespecific genes. 
 
Human embryonic stem cell data (23 transcription factor and 24 histone modification datasets) were used in combination with LASSO regression to model the binding of RNA polymerase II. The resultant models contrasted with the results from the mouse macrophage linear models in 
that using the histone modifications data in combination with the transcription factor data lead to the best models. A much more complicated picture of the regulation of RNA polymerase II binding was produced using the LASSO models. 
 
Protein-protein interactions are essential for every function within a cell and being able to predict them has large consequences for drug discovery and understanding the vast proteininteraction networks that occur within cells. Predicting protein-protein interactions is difficult 
due to the large number of possible conformations; predicting hot-spot residues can greatly reduce this. InterBasePro was compared with experimental data and subsequently adaptation was done to assess its usefulness for predicting hot-spot residues. An alternative approach 
was also made into classifying hot-spot residues based on atomic contacts.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Joseph Ward"", ids = ""144611819"")",,caf14cfa1eef6a9f5232a43c835864e45bccfd42; fcc7ee2a5ed1f3da4566d97e408c7f0bd4af330a;

73cca575a5742fac32f83dd86a0aee1a0273d498,An effective seven-CpG-based signature to predict survival in renal clear cell carcinoma by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression.,"AIMS
Currently, using clinicopathological risk factors only is not far from effective to evaluate the risk of disease progression in renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients. Molecular biomarkers might improve risk stratification of KIRC. DNA methylation occurs the whole process of tumor development and transcriptional disorders are also one of the important characteristics of tumor. Hence, this study aims to develop an effective and independent prognostic signature for KIRC patients by Integrating DNA methylation and gene expression.


MAIN METHODS
Difference analysis was conducted on DNA methylation sites and gene expression data. The Spearman's rank correlation and univariate Cox regression analysis were used to screen out the CpG sites that related with RNAs' expression and KIRC patients' overall survival. Then, a five-CpG-based prognostic classifier was established using LASSO Cox regression method.


KEY FINDINGS
The seven-CpG-based classifier can successfully divide KIRC patients into high-risk from low-risk groups, even after adjustment for standard clinical prognostic factors, such as age, stage, gender and grade. Moreover, the seven-CpG-based signature was more effective as independent prognostic factors than the combined model of these clinical factors. Six differential mRNA genes corresponding to the seven CpG sites are all related to human cancers by functional exploration. The gene functional and pathway enrichment analysis found that genes in immune-related pathways were remarkably different in high and low-risk groups.


SIGNIFICANCE
The new seven-CpG-based signature could helpfully provide insights into the underlying mechanism of KIRC and may be a powerful independent biomarker for predicting of the survival of KIRC patients.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Xu"", ids = ""145949103""); list(name = ""Jian He"", ids = ""144695776""); list(name = ""Qihang Cai"", ids = ""1482479395""); list(name = ""Menglong Li"", ids = ""2895197""); list(name = ""Xuemei Pu"", ids = ""2671534""); list(name = ""Yan-zhi Guo"", ids = ""8280092"")",,,Life sciences,,"

0980e9f6262e1839fb2fd3b61a51130b5dc85c1a,Data-driven modeling of sleep EEG and EOG reveals characteristics indicative of pre-Parkinson's and Parkinson's disease,"BACKGROUND
Manual scoring of sleep relies on identifying certain characteristics in polysomnograph (PSG) signals. However, these characteristics are disrupted in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.


NEW METHOD
This study evaluates sleep using a topic modeling and unsupervised learning approach to identify sleep topics directly from electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG). PSG data from control subjects were used to develop an EOG and an EEG topic model. The models were applied to PSG data from 23 control subjects, 25 patients with periodic leg movements (PLMs), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The data were divided into training and validation datasets and features reflecting EEG and EOG characteristics based on topics were computed. The most discriminative feature subset for separating iRBD/PD and PLM/controls was estimated using a Lasso-regularized regression model.


RESULTS
The features with highest discriminability were the number and stability of EEG topics linked to REM and N3, respectively. Validation of the model indicated a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 68.8% when classifying iRBD/PD patients.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD
The topics showed visual accordance with the manually scored sleep stages, and the features revealed sleep characteristics containing information indicative of neurodegeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that the amount of N3 and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep have potential as early PD biomarkers. Data-driven analysis of sleep may contribute to the evaluation of neurodegenerative patients.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julie A. E.

In a high dimensional setting, these models require a large number of parameters to be estimated and suffer of inferential problems. To avoid overparametrization issues, we propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior (DPP) for SUR models, which allows shrinkage of coefficients toward multiple locations. We propose a two-stage hierarchical prior distribution, where the first stage of the hierarchy consists in a lasso conditionally independent prior of the Normal-Gamma family for the coefficients. The second stage is given by a random mixture distribution, which allows for parameter parsimony through two components: the first is a random Dirac point-mass distribution, which induces sparsity in the coefficients; the second is a DPP, which allows for clustering of the coefficients.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Monica Billio"", ids = ""2714656""); list(name = ""Roberto Casarin"", ids = ""32299748""); list(name = ""Luca Rossini"", ids = ""27503210"")",,,,,139-142
86cf5bbc3bebeaaca5c0297457d5f26547c016b8,Sa38: Gwas-based Machine Learning Approach to Predict Duloxetine Response and Remission in Major Depressive Disorder,"Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is commonly treated with antidepressant drugs. However, large variability is observed in terms of response to antidepressants. GWAS based Machine Learning (ML) models may be useful to predict treatment response, thus improving antidepressant treatment. Methods A sample of 186 MDD patients received treatment with duloxetine for up to 8 weeks were categorized as â€œrespondersâ€ based on a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) change >50% from baseline; or â€œremittersâ€ based on a MADRS score of 10 or lower at end point. The initial dataset (N=186) was randomly divided into training and test sets (70% and 30%, or 130 and 56 individuals respectively), resulting in ten different training and test set pairs. A genome-wide logistic regression was performed to identify potentially significant variants related to duloxetine response/remission and extracted the most promising predictors using LASSO regression. Subsequently, Classification-Regression Trees (CRT) and support vector machines (SVM) were applied to construct models, using ten-fold, repeated cross-validation. Results For the response phenotype, LASSO regression suggested twenty SNPs to be entered in prediction models. Calculated models for response achieved accuracy of 63.43% for CRT and 78.93% for SVM. For the remission phenotype, LASSO filtering suggested five SNPs. Best models were characterized by an accuracy of 65.45% with a sensitivity of 69.31% and specificity of 61.43%. Discussion In this study, the potential of using GWAS data to predict duloxetine response was examined using ML models. These models managed to capture a fraction of responders and remitters (i.e. moderate sensitivity), but failed to filter out non-responders and non-remitters (i.e. low specificity). Inclusion of additional non-genetic variables to create integrated models may help improve prediction results.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Malgorzata Maciukiewicz"", ids = ""4603437""); list(name = ""Victoria S.

d503f974d1dcbb94264def2e11da63c9f746a629,Regression Approaches for Microarray Data Analysis,"A variety of new procedures have been devised to handle the two-sample comparison (e.g., tumor versus normal tissue) of gene expression values as measured with microarrays. Such new methods are required in part because of some defining characteristics of microarray-based studies: (i) the very large number of genes contributing expression measures which far exceeds the number of samples (observations) available and (ii) the fact that by virtue of pathway/network relationships, the gene expression measures tend to be highly correlated. These concerns are exacerbated in the regression setting, where the objective is to relate gene expression, simultaneously for multiple genes, to some external outcome or phenotype. Correspondingly, several methods have been recently proposed for addressing these issues. We briefly critique some of these methods prior to a detailed evaluation of gene harvesting. This reveals that gene harvesting, without additional constraints, can yield artifactual solutions. Results obtained employing such constraints motivate the use of regularized regression procedures such as the lasso, least angle regression, and support vector machines. Model selection and solution multiplicity issues are also discussed. The methods are evaluated using a microarray-based study of cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice.",2003,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark R.

2c037ff8d11ad1f2c15b997eeb48e7113adc4b08,Prioritizing genetic variants in GWAS with lasso using permutation-assisted tuning.,"MOTIVATION
Large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have resulted in the identification of a wide range of genetic variants related to a host of complex traits and disorders. Despite their success, the individual-SNP analysis approach adopted in most current GWAS can be limited in that it is usually biologically simple to elucidate a comprehensive genetic architecture of phenotypes and statistically underpowered due to heavy multiple testing correction burden. On the other hand, multiple-SNP analyses (e.g., gene-based or region-based SNP-set analysis) are usually more powerful to examine the joint effects of a set of SNPs on the phenotype of interest. However, current multiple-SNP approaches can only draw an overall conclusion at the SNP-set level and does not directly inform which SNPs in the SNP-set are driving the overall genotype-phenotype association.


RESULTS
In this paper, we propose a new permutation-assisted tuning procedure in lasso (plasso) to identify phenotype-associated SNPs in a joint multiple-SNP regression model in GWAS. The tuning parameter of lasso determines the amount of shrinkage and is essential to the performance of variable selection. In the proposed plasso procedure, we first generate permutations as pseudo-SNPs that are not associated with the phenotype. Then, the lasso tuning parameter is delicately chosen to separate true signal SNPs and noninformative pseudo-SNPs. We illustrate plasso using simulations to demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods, and application of plasso to a real GWAS data set gains new additional insights into the genetic control of complex traits.

d4dd534988a520c8d3211ffdfdf3d1a2f15f9e0c,Predicting drug-target interaction network using deep learning model,"BACKGROUND
Traditional methods for drug discovery are time-consuming and expensive, so efforts are being made to repurpose existing drugs. To find new ways for drug repurposing, many computational approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets extracted from drugs and targets, traditional machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression analysis, cannot analyze these data sets efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-based regularized linear classification models and a LASSO-DNN (Deep Neural Network) model based on LASSO feature selection to predict DTIs. These methods are demonstrated for repurposing drugs for breast cancer treatment.


METHODS
We collected drug descriptors, protein sequence data from Drugbank and protein domain information from NCBI. Validated DTIs were downloaded from Drugbank. A new similarity-based approach was developed to build the negative DTIs. We proposed multiple LASSO models to integrate different combinations of feature sets to explore the prediction power and predict DTIs. Furthermore, building on the features extracted from the LASSO models with the best performance, we also introduced a LASSO-DNN model to predict DTIs. The performance of our newly proposed DNN model (LASSO-DNN) was compared with the LASSO, standard logistic (SLG) regression, support vector machine (SVM), and standard DNN models.


RESULTS
Experimental results showed that the LASSO-DNN over performed the SLG, LASSO, SVM and standard DNN models. In particular, the LASSO models with protein tripeptide composition (TC) features and domain features were superior to those that contained other protein information, which may imply that TC and domain information could be better representations of proteins. Furthermore, we showed that the top ranked DTIs predicted using the LASSO-DNN model can potentially be used for repurposing existing drugs for breast cancer based on risk gene information.


CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we demonstrated that the efficient representations of drug and target features are key for building learning models for predicting DTIs. The disease-associated risk genes identified from large-scale genomic studies are the potential drug targets, which can be used for drug repurposing.",2019,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jiaying You"", ids = ""26414847""); list(name = ""Robert D.

66c3a98ef94119e565ca448dd737f6b0abaf11b1,Detection of Independent Associations of Plasma Lipidomic Parameters with Insulin Sensitivity Indices Using Data Mining Methodology,"OBJECTIVE
Glucolipotoxicity is a major pathophysiological mechanism in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We aimed to detect subtle changes in the circulating lipid profile by shotgun lipidomics analyses and to associate them with four different insulin sensitivity indices.


METHODS
The cross-sectional study comprised 90 men with a broad range of insulin sensitivity including normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 33), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 32) and newly detected T2D (n = 25). Prior to oral glucose challenge plasma was obtained and quantitatively analyzed for 198 lipid molecular species from 13 different lipid classes including triacylglycerls (TAGs), phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen/ether (PC O-s), sphingomyelins (SMs), and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). To identify a lipidomic signature of individual insulin sensitivity we applied three data mining approaches, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forests (RF) for the following insulin sensitivity indices: homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose insulin sensitivity index (GSI), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and disposition index (DI). The LASSO procedure offers a high prediction accuracy and and an easier interpretability than SVR and RF.


RESULTS
After LASSO selection, the plasma lipidome explained 3% (DI) to maximal 53% (HOMA-IR) variability of the sensitivity indexes. Among the lipid species with the highest positive LASSO regression coefficient were TAG 54:2 (HOMA-IR), PC O- 32:0 (GSI), and SM 40:3:1 (ISI). The highest negative regression coefficient was obtained for LPC 22:5 (HOMA-IR), TAG 51:1 (GSI), and TAG 58:6 (ISI).


CONCLUSION
Although a substantial part of lipid molecular species showed a significant correlation with insulin sensitivity indices we were able to identify a limited number of lipid metabolites of particular importance based on the LASSO approach. These few selected lipids with the closest connection to sensitivity indices may help to further improve disease risk prediction and disease and therapy monitoring.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Steffi Kopprasch"", ids = ""6919472""); list(name = ""Srirangan Dheban"", ids = ""7403313""); list(name = ""Kai Schuhmann"", ids = ""3363337""); list(name = ""Aimin Xu"", ids = ""1684089""); list(name = ""Klaus-martin Schulte"", ids = ""80126826""); list(name = ""Charmaine J Simeonovic"", ids = ""5359247""); list(name = ""Peter E H Schwarz"", ids = ""152666038""); list(name = ""Stefan R.

7e7b607bc615f45dd5c98728d71479e77d63a20e,Inflammatory bowel disease and patterns of volatile organic compounds in the exhaled breath of children: A case-control study using Ion Molecule Reaction-Mass Spectrometry,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) profoundly affect quality of life and have been gradually increasing in incidence, prevalence and severity in many areas of the world, and in children in particular. Patients with suspected IBD require careful history and clinical examination, while definitive diagnosis relies on endoscopic and histological findings. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the alveolar air of pediatric patients with IBD presents a specific volatile organic compounds' (VOCs) pattern when compared to controls. Patients 10-17 years of age, were divided into four groups: Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), controls with gastrointestinal symptomatology, and surgical controls with no evidence of gastrointestinal problems. Alveolar breath was analyzed by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry. Four models were built starting from 81 molecules plus the age of subjects as independent variables, adopting a penalizing LASSO logistic regression approach: 1) IBDs vs. controls, finally based on 18 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 69%, AUC = 0.925); 2) CD vs. UC, finally based on 13 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 76%, AUC = 0.934); 3) IBDs vs. gastroenterological controls, finally based on 15 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 65%, AUC = 0.918); 4) IBDs vs. controls, built starting from the 21 directly or indirectly calibrated molecules only, and finally based on 12 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 71%, AUC = 0.888). The molecules identified by the models were carefully studied in relation to the concerned outcomes. This study, with the creation of models based on VOCs profiles, precise instrumentation and advanced statistical methods, can contribute to the development of new non-invasive, fast and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tools, with high sensitivity and specificity. It also represents a crucial step towards gaining further insights on the etiology of IBD through the analysis of specific molecules which are the expression of the particular metabolism that characterizes these patients.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lorenzo Monasta"", ids = ""3640778""); list(name = ""Chiara Pierobon"", ids = ""11632937""); list(name = ""Andrea Princivalle"", ids = ""4767578""); list(name = ""Stefano Martelossi"", ids = ""5024413""); list(name = ""Annalisa Marcuzzi"", ids = ""5384617""); list(name = ""Francesco Pasini"", ids = ""47596951""); list(name = ""Luigi Perbellini"", ids = ""4324749"")",e3d901c2c80db622f6cfbf92b03ee403b6e4a9b6; 21280a5c70f0a6ccab1bb6e6f051faf6a255f3ce; 04f05d3a0b08dd43296d272ba83d268769047f73; 991fc0c6759a40561cfc4e32ccacd5d17b47dc24; 005b3900a1eec115d55ca1c8c2464358fcc5ee59; 10fd15dc8cefe9555cd7b09a6487c46e705e8def,ef4c1b0feebe1bf06bbec90e0e1da050d0851fd4; 6664f4407469c090b014a1cf2cc94b7d785ccaf5; b88fc4c3538badc0c47ba6e42c1d26c085164d7d; 133a34cff28f50cbfbaa1871ff04da76188199c6; c9fd0cba5703d7ba860742346cb77855b2b0c519; 647fc5b42d6ce765543b5975a1755fe9fbfc0d81; d3ce7a4ea860f028c1584a4515dfaf9ecba508ea; 28828613ecc4f425278d05acaf538af05ce2d4be; 479a4954acbacccf59ffd94c0dda221fb52f94fc; 6eeda145bcea9967841033b5bb5e65c42ad904e3; 7c8d43efd6ba7dde344fc7d49e8c801b52428ac6; b952daf5e7e1668275716d7c38fd255704700542; c0c92f8ca6eb5e00ba93cf0f16125c2cfd7c0775; e07268a5fe920827e9391db63d331070edbcf451; 0920cbbb781efc232390c4894545258994e93370; 834bc07354debf6d1549fe1ac1c611a6e6002c22; a7f82e6b75d9b084dab4f23b898db09807333410; 0533b48d6b9366f7ca660d681d1eab27606ab62d; 804dd1ef77abfaa5f941b766d3b4fcac3f5a7700; 5ce21c59ee854bba87b911952230eea2a2b93f09; 814ab8d21fedb877601e5af154e882e25b150a0d; f9a5faf2c18a3053e7ee6de79494ac1315e0a865; 4a414447ba24fc03082b20ac540d3e2f44686855; df2c13b2e4d911c3d9836d6c87bd50f14f09db50; fdf2201705ca9692ab462f0c49c5b353d8f8962e; 144a01878f87f223ec307602eb79d86e6a3f7520; 41cd9a9488ecdba1e498a974e6532789549a49b0; aa6f1713441fa2c8cb0838a68d6e11ae005af58e; f55094cbdd30b4f338ad5ae431afba4df8c3d477; 687dab3cf79c425065e3d33b73aa4b1eca175f1a; 9c35b0d169a5e494869351f03e4d3f393f1cb1a7; 446be3c71e90b9525ff9c15ddb623371c725a580; b16683a9f93f7bf54b55067438e565461a87ff6d; fe928660eab3b84ddd5ef49120d32c50d7af2bbd; aa6993b5b38b6141aff75e537e5897d93c99a475; c0910601cd45aa7e38d56679d9e3889b042b0eea; 96fc5ea1d79d5349ac0c3bade56affbae84d3d1e; f200d3c0c2fedb49006219a04b9587e46ba7e01c; 0bac1944aeb6af32ac8356d534eb72a2c31e4642; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; fb47770061aee890d09728d2932045d3f93b7fcd; 5f44312aa4f9c444f74f4b73e5e60b83b53132cd; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 4754b370744c5febeca145ee7106d1247eacc43e; 7dbd009ebfe3d3d74a7b46757d007674df34c26d; 81433abfdd9068140ecfa2741da2d60caadc88ba; d7cf70389dcfd45ea69406b4d6fc134e3c1322f1; c2d35722fd12917806fd6ba74504e341c16becc2; 6a6cac52be6edf83315e9f70bc3b547371cf364f; e7d5e03fafd462c076f293fc333ae724d7f6c170; 14cf2f28fabcc8fe0af4b09b261e51422f30b3e4; 13a685be18cdaf941c95108a676c668a462f75bb; 953762da0ed3de8256f6d376fd5d83aa19b9360d; 370942023b6209949e1ca9c1ac501f0e4afcf25f; 4ecd2b07a39c87046de9a7a8dbe345b8e2bf0809; d485203bb6b6e04c40b707ee44e231fec45cbcab; c6042b44e4f4b239766c4c2f9c7991b83b6e3fe1; 1bd7f36e394bd1f78aba1cc362486348949122d8; d52c373a2bed18736bae781b6159173542b72266; bbf965e97c51014ed44cc20297f6d5d3111987fa; 8e86868822cbf6b6ad2b1ca5c4490890ccb7f4b3; 288cd76aacb4226d8a50da0b69519f1b9d9ca680; 33889980f6f8e05bf053eb0b5877ac35096aba2e; 63c2b9a99fd382c18808c4015d9a73fd6f1a9d7d; 4cb418854f08166a07aca66aa055832ab5f4cf52; 1e02ecde66be34898ca07e882cf68762d8f173e2; 0311937e20446b5a338539ca4125a9cc4942ec2c; 62f8fa8349a3cc08da621ef626d65bdbee03fc57; 29a5d34b95107e25eeefb94904f8cba442dcaf7d; 375261e17d0a2983471dd75c39237577a8ad5490; 940d9a52c7a4983d3d4065e97ad7c41be2b79af8; 16c0777a17012ac0f6a37a796f9acf845d04ef85; 5bf4793d4dcd5ed5c62bdc23edd4a84d8a443145; 16490e40cc7771aacae10de825d1db6de44bd243; 673f77d7f9410535481ced8317a57da92247a912; 6555a0c85bfb5e0144b7b016751b2d211328949a; ecd880c0485b75429796b25eac2f42c7cb648bc9; 08c2e5e0f4c2256347ade4d49fc882bb7ce3678b; 077356a78bb19b61239eed1897ec78a2a9f6f77f; 5af384c4347701eab539ff5390d789daeef14049; 525716729f85a4212dcc3b46d18d1c9058f508b2; 3366a8e17d6f42d3a8a28983e4deac409b8331e5,PLoS ONE,12,
cb41af81747f23b841bdbf13ebda0f9d4b9aca43,Integrated transcriptomic analysis reveals hub genes involved in diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer,"BackgroundThe hunt for the molecular markers with specificity and sensitivity has been a hot area for the tumor treatment. Due to the poor diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC), the excision rate is often low, which makes it more urgent to find the ideal tumor markers.MethodsRobust Rank Aggreg (RRA) methods was firstly applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PC tissues and normal tissues from GSE28735, GSE15471, GSE16515, and GSE101448. Among these DEGs, the highly correlated genes were clustered using WGCNA analysis. The co-expression networks and molecular complex detection (MCODE) Cytoscape app were then performed to find the sub-clusters and confirm 35 candidate genes. For these genes, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression model was applied and validated to build a diagnostic risk score model. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used and validated to build a prognostic model.ResultsBased on integrated transcriptomic analysis, we identified a 19 gene module (SYCN, PNLIPRP1, CAP2, GNMT, MAT1A, ABAT, GPT2, ADHFE1, PHGDH, PSAT1, ERP27, PDIA2, MT1H, COMP, COL5A2, FN1, COL1A2, FAP and POSTN) as a specific predictive signature for the diagnosis of PC. Based on the two consideration, accuracy and feasibility, we simplified the diagnostic risk model as a four-gene model: 0.3034*log2(MAT1A)-0.1526*log2(MT1H)â€‰+â€‰0.4645*log2(FN1) -0.2244*log2(FAP), log2(gene count). Besides, a four-hub gene module was also identified as prognostic modelâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰1.400*log2(CEL)â€‰+â€‰1.321*log2(CPA1)â€‰+â€‰0.454*log2(POSTN)â€‰+â€‰1.011*log2(PM20D1), log2(gene count).ConclusionIntegrated transcriptomic analysis identifies two four-hub gene modules as specific predictive signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis of PC, which may bring new sight for the clinical practice of PC.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang-Yang Zhou"", ids = ""47943287""); list(name = ""Liping Chen"", ids = ""46307908""); list(name = ""Yaoshen Zhang"", ids = ""10778949""); list(name = ""Sun-kuan Hu"", ids = ""8052707""); list(name = ""Zhaojun Dong"", ids = ""153565307""); list(name = ""Ming Wu"", ids = ""145966956""); list(name = ""Qiuxiang Chen"", ids = ""12305481""); list(name = ""Zhizhi Zhuang"", ids = ""4967182""); list(name = ""Xiao-Jing Du"", ids = ""80461271"")",21bf3a59d4e6dc87ff38d5fa37b67f65bfc18758; b5857acc7275ca4297de9f067e05cfecbc73f0ee,e4bfbd0473700f1b004402207478c774c03b7822; d8bd861b292233072aa40ab6bc029ac94d7f30af; 20032a9dd74bc43edf4fdf07db360f7d2b7389ec; 9d434f5f6131e37aa21e232aedaccc874ff7e3ee; 0485990c183322e058c2911b8c020fdcf4d0f886; 6e1e6afb314f9c5a24d744252a30aa5efc313571; 2291d082d9b6912f4744b9a467a6a6ad667d9ce5; 37899ab8d0b24b62ef29929d6b26e9afc3b11cc4; 523b884aedf15f41218ce950795341007b3a5a82; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; 25ba75f3f6cc15713fca34e9c11aa4e617fa2a13; e08791ddbca9e5716e9b53d417e24962964f4edb; 73e858c2a45f8339844e8701d335d27c10c1717e; 944c96bbcba307110f83e5c9424d3bdce15b3ddd; 2e727d4b1e3cc2fee205f7c3363d58009bf6950f; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 0ef8ab8721fcdb2898248759907fbe473701e177; 552aa19fa44ecb8d3d920d2e0a1d0d4c05a92702; 960e687c9622bde89dd4c4ea2903fadbf2bc3958; bd96dfff2ef1b8e6184d4e092c7111b92b424241; fa8e8d83afb876f6897cdb9441a9570a3050c7ea; 30cf9a0507f45256bd58f4c041d9b413ac0b65e8; 8ad3102328eb4014ac19934092c4640e358b767e; 55fa27c3f75fa78eb4a490e3f3c19d4beb126eb5; b56d15e6bed9fdc5f2b692ea39bb8ec7363d2551; c2f3a2c9223b27f4d9a5f40cde30d1e2d338dc79; e7148e7327e8445c736510c3681a999c6cf8203b; 9e461faac125ed6dc3cad9ce7a7d505b38958a98; efbda10616ece3409e2452f40419f28470399c41; 09d6e831e4ba2d3801e6de39508dbe7044445072; ab4033e5bdfd05812901fe88bf2676d536ed9a31; c02a7be539752859b59816dfd4f4c08d9f8e13d2; 4b3a3eb0e841d4c23f74687c8d0b4ba3538103da; 4a7288901a69f1bd5b7c2ec173ec2207d6fc20a1; 02e4cb193239ce47ecca87d7158d6da1fc6bb291; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; 5d0507674f7eb1568e312ac9c84c099982ee89a2; b1d74b319ed59caedbe93daefcc520a1c4ef9875; 1372ac23a4727b2b062c93342e78e42a2547db05; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 75ca252b6c7226f0ff978b3c695f200748fb0536; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 155cb8bf1ee8f0549a4543a6be3b60fa26763f25; e1c1beead2f1bd31d9701aec11d3aa2740784e15; 5fafeaaeb4256584cb840e5726cc78f8da34840d; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; ca097155934e8eed360295d21e44cafb0c0d38ec; 6609d8eb61940e604c75e3abd360e05aa050f9e2; fdfbffffda87d3dafdf31cf1fa727d15d0e64376; 55db1d55a9c328718c269ec6ec4c1bc35657a8b8; 1d42a5aea2da8e6fb1be4b5ce7f355a4d1d6ef0a; b6dabbfedd0affd953ab0e208d829be8b94a2a85; 906eb3922b89c0b8c0b64a3d90250b29b0edb93e; c0c0bd874870ed81ab24f3bed9beae8d210bdf7e; deba7736855f97f8611568921e5f78029d701167; 0c2f81d7ed9c37768d02923a9929c6783b392afe; 13bae0189ceed3604252aa9e14951fb4feb960f9; 1f81217f1d3b370243f00a67f3de750b3cfbcb64; 67967cbfdfc3e568d7c04f1ed412979884c2d8c5; 3f076549215f1666866c024936462912813a8a1b; ebcf02272d3a0fbfaf58038e16b8f661292170d5; c6b2242c024bbd41acf40857061c8213a94dd6e0; a5121e3e9b81b8d43ac11566101e92b4a269a6ec; f8917291798154f96053ec578f17e24b6b36bbef; 9bc76fbf7bb7f0cc2c5e074ba12605cc336e6abd; aef9a72ddbd6c8e3f9202b3bb493f4b29dcde3b7; d6b0c40908d3d87fdbf8b3ba20ac50d00f4a5d2f; 587f77152cb2171fe29f1892b0de540d9f8d02d4; e98f955653dc6bfe502fb7526f64daf668ef5904; 6a926d2b3bb6b9ac29a1227df072fe27348011ec; e7cefc9b7dcd740190ab8f9fcd9d92cc2d277276,Molecular Medicine,25,

To improve the weakness of SCAD for high noise level, we propose a new penalty function called MSCAD which relaxes the unbiasedness condition of SCAD. In order to compare MSCAD with LASSO and SCAD, comparative studies are performed on simulated datasets and also on a real dataset. The performances of penalized regression methods are compared in terms of relative model error and the estimates of coefficients.

d32036e83cfa73f99907d991a64147871a074949,Building Energy Use Prediction Owing to Climate Change: A Case Study of a University Campus,"Global warming is expected to increase of 1.5Â°C between 2030 and 2052. This may lead to an increase in building energy consumption. With the changing climate, cities, communities, and university campuses need a more dynamic forecasting model to predict their future energy demands to mitigate risks. Although many building energy prediction models have been developed, only a few have focused on climate change and its impacts. This paper discusses the development of a regression-based forecasting model for a university campus energy use under changing climate. The forecasting model development follows a four-step process: (1) data frame setting, (2) descriptive statistics, (3) statistical regression modeling, and (4) validation and prediction. The independent numeric variables used as inputs are building characteristics (gross square feet, lighting power density, equipment power density; U factor of roof, wall, and windows; building age; years after building renovation; and window-to-wall ratio) and weather data (temperature and humidity). The outputs are electricity and chilled water for 2054. Prior to modeling, matrix plots and histograms are used to identify correlations between variables. This step is followed by normalization of independent variables to check their impact. Finally, multiple linear regression model for electricity and Lasso regression models for chilled water estimations are developed. For the purpose of predicting energy consumption owing to climate change, we used weather data that represents 2054.

Nuclear morphometry can measure up to 93 unique nuclear features based on standard histopathology. The goal of this work is to build novel, objective, and accurate prediction tools, based on nuclear morphometric signatures in high resolution images of nuclei of histologic sections, for classifying pancreatic tissues into three distinct groups. Materials & Methods: 44 patients who underwent pancreatic resections were identified. 12 cases of CP, 16 cases of IPMN, and 16 cases of PC were utilized in this pilot study. 180 Â± 22 nuclei from each lesion were imaged with high resolution microscopy. Clincodemographic data was obtained retrospectively from the medical record. Statistically significant nuclear features were determined by a fully automated penalized multinomial regression algorithm in order to determine a multi-class classifier and simultaneously identify important nuclear features. The LASSO penalty function, and associated regularization parameter, is adaptively chosen by cross validation to prevent over-fitting. In order to test the veracity of the automated algorithm, we randomly removed 25% of the cases as a training set and utilized the remaining cases as a test set; this was repeated 10 times. Results: The average age was 64 Â± 15 years, with patients in the CP being slightly younger; 63% were male. Median follow-up time was 3 years in the CP group, 3 years in the IPMN group, and 5 years in PC group. The method described automatically identified 6 unique and statistically significant nuclear features (corrected overall P Conclusions: Nuclear morphometry classifies pancreatic lesions into CP, IPMN, and PC with 84.5% accuracy using a fully automated algorithm to determine statistically significant and unique nuclear features. Since the incorrectly classified lesions had a larger proportion of mixed nuclei, diagnostic uncertainty may be determined in a quantitative manner allowing for a confidence probability estimation of whether a given lesions should be classified as a CP, IPMN, or PC. Further studies will validate these results in a resected cohort as well as a cohort based on biopsied specimens alone. Citation Format: Evan S. Glazer, Hao Zhang, Kimberly A.
