037f17e5a3911acdf48cb5d8066e8e28cddc8001,Nomogram-based prediction of rebleeding in small bowel bleeding patients: the â€˜PRSBBâ€™ score,"Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) and balloon-assisted endoscopy (BAE) have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel bleeding (SBB), allowing access to the small bowel and identification of specific bleeding lesions. However, some patients experience rebleeding after small bowel investigation, and there are no definitive algorithms for determining the most appropriate follow-up strategy in SBB patients. We developed and validated a nomogram that can predict rebleeding risk and be used to develop a risk-stratified follow-up strategy in SBB patients. A retrospective study was performed using data from 401 SBB patients who underwent SBCE at Nagoya University Hospital. We developed and internally validated a predictive model for rebleeding in the form of a nomogram using Cox regression models and a bootstrap resampling procedure. Optimal risk factors were selected according to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The LASSO method identified 8 independent predictors of rebleeding that could be assessed to obtain a â€˜predicting rebleeding in SBBâ€™, or â€˜PRSBBâ€™ score: age, sex, SBB type, transfusion requirement, cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, SBCE findings, and treatment. The c-statistic for the predictive model was 0.681. In conclusion, our PRSBB score can help clinicians devise appropriate follow-up plans.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Genta Uchida"", ids = ""34737610""); list(name = ""Yoshiki Hirooka"", ids = ""40291703""); list(name = ""Masanao Nakamura"", ids = ""3990334""); list(name = ""Osamu Watanabe"", ids = ""143707260""); list(name = ""Takeshi Yamamura"", ids = ""49382849""); list(name = ""Masanobu Matsushita"", ids = ""6494228""); list(name = ""Hiroki Suhara"", ids = ""37708965""); list(name = ""Takuya Ishikawa"", ids = ""3136252""); list(name = ""Kazuhiro Furukawa"", ids = ""2746071""); list(name = ""Kohei Funasaka"", ids = ""4164721""); list(name = ""Eizaburo Ohno"", ids = ""3654387""); list(name = ""Hiroki Kawashima"", ids = ""33900697""); list(name = ""Ryoji Miyahara"", ids = ""3061307""); list(name = ""Hidemi Goto"", ids = ""144412027"")",,50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; cf2bbbfd0bb5e78c3b63d388a08578e748d70060; bfbe594aaa7720d8dc8d90427bf55874ad3349e9; 81d39cb76aec1b3dcb7582d3829fc7faccf0505f; 33fa83528f91d81470982e8951694630e212f9a9; 1b0657eed0c996bf4ad53a3377548139a17ab9a2; 4432b5403ca2f6695eb36acd4cd042bdd0548ec8; 0b92b5d1b51a94f9dab453a091c5ff9d0316c92f; dfd513a6a1dc98fe478a119023775e6dc387e586; 413b0fe841c2210d9553b34c889d403e15223ab7; df796c017ebb784ed04557d03edeabf5659428af; de4c801f048cfe718026d1c5367ac5240fa5263d; 682a5e4a3126df6ac219b41b1a71af2ffb238055; b776f91dadd59b674ba0e4b625c93b6aede7f89d; f4da17a9ede67de4e5681633f3ed9f0890167d8f; 2d492015d9e434bcca175b04d68a47219ad59154; 6620495006d4d15b75dfaaae10799a45e03d33bd; 43abba851e79eb451f27d3511e2e64cc94f013c8; 1b497473c76f8f59204bfe9be116af8e822b28ba; c56cba699b32fdf0a104abf5cc633248ca4949ea; 17c7b750ed4f91ee438f9b7efd7b26ffa80af01d; 9562138f1b1366408e723ba113ee5ffb6e1e57a1; 6b7ec6853eb6ff48656f2ca7dd5241b5a3b9c92c; 0fa6bdd29d8e09c70877e25bd9354968ba635ba5; 351d4e1a23bfd870dfc8ddd1c19398cbbcdfccc5; d21addd147d9839cd07698efb130afa15dda598e; a6d33daa0e093a50b1b58e3aa34191c4b5acda92; d5c91148098c2433e80c9d6f59e83c2e1a7fd28e; 9baa391c0b40433204578934b8852a4da6d30676; cafb89a9660b4c9e4c9151dd024ad1b68f1cdea9,Scientific Reports,8,
f2fe3b0731f90ea2d094ee4c338a0fe799844cff,Predictive Modelling of Home Appliances Energy Consumption in Belgium,"The increasing trend in energy consumption is becoming cause of concern for the entire world, as the energy consumption is increasing year after year so is the carbon and greenhouse gas emission, the majority portion of the electricity generated is consumed by industrial sector but a considerable amount is also consumed by residential sector. It is important to study the energy consuming behaviour in the residential sector and predict the energy consumption by home appliances as it consume maximum amount of energy in the residence. The European energy goal of 2020 is to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emission by 20%. This project focuses on predicting the energy consumption of home appliances based on humidity and temperature. It has resulted in implementation of five prediction regression models, i.e. multiple regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, SVM regression and Random Forest are developed and results are presented based on RMSE, MAE and MAPE, the dataset for the analysis was taken from a house located in Stambruges (Belgium), keeping European goal of 2020 in mind. In addition the results of reviewed literature of home energy consumption in Europe is also presented.",2018,Environmental Science,"list(name = ""Anant Chaudhary"", ids = ""32067274"")",,,,,
9c6de4191eae7167cd237deb42db9087540b3a3a,Efficient Regularized Regression with L 0 Penalty for Variable Selection and Network Construction,"Variable selections for regression with high-dimensional big data have found many applications in bioinformatics and computational biology. One appealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number of nonzero features in the model directly. However, it is well known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose efficient EM (L0EM) and dual L0EM (DL0EM) algorithms that directly approximate the L0 optimization problem. While L0EM is efficient with large sample size, DL0EM is efficient with high-dimensional (n â‰ª m) data. They also provide a natural solution to all Lp â€‰â€‰p âˆˆ [0,2] problems, including lasso with p = 1 and elastic net with p âˆˆ [1,2]. The regularized parameter Î» can be determined through cross validation or AIC and BIC. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional genomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than lasso, SCAD, and MC+, and L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive cross validation. The proposed algorithms are efficient in identifying the nonzero variables with less bias and constructing biologically important networks with high-dimensional big data.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhenqiu Liu"", ids = ""34396988""); list(name = ""Gang Li"", ids = ""46439197"")",ff02136d7ee54ca38d7f4012e5787596ac417159; d10ac125a6ea54b4327513f6fad81c833880716b; 58720b8531a1b42bc26e4281da72c4fa949749cc; 9241ad38ba3ea94fa0c8d0e68a809c936b9096ec,e8d982355b7b74d1bc46f45aec68af97eb644902; 92295645390f83e697961e8457f405bf7879a063; d7504d6d264bf5d26a674ffa932a5cdb4f194e1e; 72f3e4642231cbf9db3df3a31c69a21f3b746b49; 6489bcb76d823e20c44d428c147f0dd8a5cdaa00; 4a65a734231c44125579c9b13a3c7a44a35af222; bb53f1ccbbe8aa65bba77051292d6604cbb862be; 52b876a95eb4db5bb8e093e98a2649c53253b428; a50cda55ac39ec5096de1c6d83900f3d0130628d; fb8e3c3c8517005ad7ca71da8024da3b1f7d9ed8; 1158d6151fc75e045072b7a469c27d9f076b3038; 8d80042dc9cf9afb9f887dd653908bb7f08370dd; 0ef9286e4d782555c1ad1b5abc9fedf6ed01daa5; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; f9f15d0c475479c5afa6e53691cd8e0b16752ffc; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; aa40973222722a3b16f8f90c96f2abbb2ad92d10; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ef8161b95ba86b2644b56bfffa54f0926843376a; 14483b3304ff3b6b17b4aaa3f2f9540e35ad5ef7; 5f5bbfc164ffde5a124b738fd0de6f3c1e34a390; 31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; b422da5478649f8f09e43bb1b7f31e7179f1ced8; 3fc17a36e2bec28396fd17c1ec2288d817564565; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; fe55e2efa148b97f2b16d28f695d1a9b792413c4; f26b1a228679cd54b2392cc74436d6dbc072937e; 0a1a47716071179b57a91f7218a1b36cfb6e63bd; f511d57b2e1490c0921f40c643c55d2a778ec1fb; f1c538e6635ea8384ec00154d9c7473a48c8eaf0; e2d1cf15b2cddc51212a74f89ae9c40d1a2d4836; 9910b9fb2d3c3e50240153b79b4de6ebaac8ff49; cca94d07cd397041fe33870a393da03b034ea634; d49fcaf2314659817b433b6fb13e386bc365d034; d6eafda96440e0cb54150be5f2938f008fd9a978; f4c0653ea82eeb07b216c376beff7f6396bd7535; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2016,

In this work, we aim to learn a network structure from temporal panel data, employing the framework of Granger causal models under the assumptions of sparsity of its edges and inherent grouping structure among its nodes. To that end, we introduce a group lasso regression regularization framework, and also examine a thresholded variant to address the issue of group misspecification. Further, the norm consistency and variable selection consistency of the estimates is established, the latter under the novel concept of direction consistency. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed through an extensive set of simulation studies and comparisons with existing techniques. The study is illustrated on two motivating examples coming from functional genomics and financial econometrics.",2013,,"list(name = ""Adam Sales"", ids = ""33063575""); list(name = ""Sumanta Basu"", ids = ""3352106"")",,,,,
46dbd2c18e811a7bacc2696114abe3e15d9c46d5,Sparse Brain Network Recovery Under Compressed Sensing,"Partial correlation is a useful connectivity measure for brain networks, especially, when it is needed to remove the confounding effects in highly correlated networks. Since it is difficult to estimate the exact partial correlation under the small-n large-p situation, a sparseness constraint is generally introduced. In this paper, we consider the sparse linear regression model with a l1-norm penalty, also known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), for estimating sparse brain connectivity. LASSO is a well-known decoding algorithm in the compressed sensing (CS). The CS theory states that LASSO can reconstruct the exact sparse signal even from a small set of noisy measurements. We briefly show that the penalized linear regression for partial correlation estimation is related to CS. It opens a new possibility that the proposed framework can be used for a sparse brain network recovery. As an illustration, we construct sparse brain networks of 97 regions of interest (ROIs) obtained from FDG-PET imaging data for the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children and the pediatric control (PedCon) subjects. As validation, we check the network reproducibilities by leave-one-out cross validation and compare the clustered structures derived from the brain networks of ASD and PedCon.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyekyoung Lee"", ids = ""1960903""); list(name = ""Dong Soo Lee"", ids = ""1808026""); list(name = ""Hyejin Kang"", ids = ""34690610""); list(name = ""Boong-Nyun Kim"", ids = ""144655811""); list(name = ""Moo K.

RELR leads to reliable variable shortlisting and stable parameter reduction processes that overcome the dual curses of dimensionality and complexity. RELR is fundamentally different from arbitrary regression coefficient smoothing methods like Lasso and Penalized Logistic Regression, as it models nonarbitrary error estimates. This paper will review this new supervised learning machine and show that it can perform decisively better than standard methods including Penalized Logistic Regression. RELR does not use validation sample information in training, so its reduced error compared to Penalized Logistic Regression is especially significant.",2008,,"list(name = ""Daniel M.

Mean function regression models with low-dimensional covariates have been extensively considered in the literature. However, it is important to develop a robust alternative to find the underlying relationship between medical costs and high-dimensional covariates. In this paper, we propose a new quantile regression model to analyze medical costs. We also consider variable selection, using an adaptive lasso penalized variable selection method to identify significant factors of the covariates. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the performance of the estimation method. We apply our method to the analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey dataset.",2018,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiaobing Zhao"", ids = ""48551246""); list(name = ""Weiwei Wang"", ids = ""49337463""); list(name = ""Lei Liu"", ids = ""46457995""); list(name = ""Ya-Chen Tina Shih"", ids = ""145328494"")",,,Statistics in medicine,37 17,"

Our strategy involves two modeling approaches for the newly available data, one combining binary covariate selection via LASSO with logistic regression and one based on logic trees. The results of these models are then compared to the results of a model based on existing data with the objective of combining model results to achieve the most accurate predictions. The combination of model predictions is aided by the use of support vector machines to identify subspaces of the covariate space in which specific models lead to successful predictions.

fffb8e131017041e58cdff9a08536b5263780e4f,Combining Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Winter Wheat Yield in the Conterminous United States,"Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops, supplying essential food for the world population. Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R2=0.86, RMSE=0.51 t/ha, MAE=0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R2>0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined.",2020,Computer Science; Geology,"list(name = ""Yumiao Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Zuxun Zhang"", ids = ""1801050""); list(name = ""Luwei Feng"", ids = ""27620638""); list(name = ""Qingyun Du"", ids = ""31486023""); list(name = ""Troy Runge"", ids = ""38601692"")",,,Remote Sensing,12,1232

Generally, the choice of a color space is different for different visual tasks. How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, we propose a sparse tensor discriminant color space (STDCS) model that represents a color image as a third-order tensor in this paper. The model cannot only keep the underlying spatial structure of color images but also enhance robustness and give intuitionistic or semantic interpretation. STDCS transforms the eigenvalue problem to a series of regression problems. Then one spare color space transformation matrix and two sparse discriminant projection matrices are obtained by applying lasso or elastic net on the regression problems. The experiments on three color face databases, AR, Georgia Tech, and Labeled Faces in the Wild face databases, show that both the performance and the robustness of the proposed method outperform those of the state-of-the-art TDCS model.",2012,Computer Science;

However, scarce is known about the problem of PARI and its associated factors amongst university students thought it has been firmly appreciated for children and adolescents. Objective This study, supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31640038), aimed to explore the characteristics of PARI and its risk factors among university students in two Chinese cities (namely Shantou, Guangdong and Jinan, Shandong). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four universities, where 1421 students Year 1â€“3 were selected randomly and invited to complete the questionnaires during April and May via the one-on-one investigation after their completion of the baseline survey in March and April, 2017. Information of socio-demographics, PA involvement, risk-taking behaviors, and PARI experience in the past 12 months and its related characteristics were collected. The group Lasso and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for PARI. Findings Totally, 486 PARIs were reported by 289 students, with an overall incidence rate of 0.82 injuries/1000 exposure hours of PA participation. Most injuries involved the lower extremities, were newly occurring and medically treated injuries, occurred in outdoor PA (skating, football and basketball particularly) and non-contact situations, with sprain and strain being the major injury types. Over half of the injured (52.1%) experienced an inactivity period of 2 days or above. Significant differences were seen between males and females. PARI was associated with city, gender, study year, club membership, higher vigorous-intensity PA (VPA) volume, and antisocial behaviors. Conclusion and policy implications The above data reinforce the necessary of implementing conditioning and practical programs to underpin the injury mechanism to prevent university students from PARI and maximize the benefits of PA.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Weicong Cai"", ids = ""29802790""); list(name = ""Liping Li"", ids = ""49192869""); list(name = ""Cun-Xian Jia"", ids = ""35654746"")",,,Injury Prevention,24,A177

In this work, we present theoretical guarantees for the performance of a sparse regression based unmixing (in short, sparse unmixing) implemented in the form of a Lasso optimization with non-negativity constraints. We provide a sufficient condition required for the exact recovery of the endmembers and validate it both theoretically and through experiments. In cases in which the condition is not verified, we explore the performance of sparse unmixing in relation to the exact recovery coefficient (ERC).",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yuki Itoh"", ids = ""144274505""); list(name = ""Marco F.

5f684d5a8bfd659bb2457eae775afe24d412bcdf,A Fast Em Algorithm for Quadratic Optimization Subject to Convex Constraints,"Convex constraints (CCs) such as box constraints and linear inequal- ity constraints appear frequently in statistical inference and in applications. The problems of quadratic optimization (QO) subject to CCs occur in isotonic regres- sion, shape-restricted non-parametric regression, variable selection (via the lasso algorithm and bridge regression), limited dependent variables models, image recon- struction, and so on. Existing packages for QO are not generally applicable to CCs. Although EM-type algorithms may be applied to such problems (Tian, Ng and Tan (2005)), the convergence rate/speed of these algorithms is painfully slow, especially for high-dimensional data. This paper develops a fast EM algorithm for QO with CCs. We construct a class of data augmentation schemes indexed by a 'work- ing parameter' r (r 2 R), and then optimize r over R under several convergence criteria. In addition, we use Cholesky decomposition to reduce both the number of latent variables and the dimension, leading to further acceleration of the EM. Standard errors of the restricted estimators are calculated using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure. Simulation and comparison are performed and a complex multinomial dataset is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ming Tan"", ids = ""144158096""); list(name = ""Gaoyou Tian"", ids = ""50720764""); list(name = ""Hong-Bin Fang"", ids = ""2729728""); list(name = ""Kai Wang Ng"", ids = ""37064360"")",ebae5eca3d229950b8171bd2c63849c553a0730e; 504d39896c7634405b23ce0cb723a41e6fc54530; c44972f46a220f24aaa468c6e3a499036340243d; 94cab329b366f172a36fe529d5570da5ec193451; ec6311555fd8a5d3f05fb0fc9ddc8cf7bd80a10d; c480a248c3493968be6aea01c81c1c08425ca5b3; 5403601c4a55f4b499cf601b2d5a1a84bd1b5006; 68da4ef3e5bf9596ce779daf9c895f67ad398574; de4126d67f88b54e6aaf0d07ea83cf587cbd34f0,,,,

Immediately or after head-and-neck (H&N) cancer chemoradiotherapy (CRT), patients may undergone significant sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) which could affect their quality of life. Radiomic feature analysis is proposed to predict SNHL induced by CRT.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
490 image features of 94 cochlea from 47 patients treated with three dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) for different H&N cancers were extracted from CT images. Different machine learning (ML) algorithms and also least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized logistic regression were implemented on radiomic features for feature selection, classification and prediction. Also, LASSO penalized logistic model was used for outcome modelling.


RESULTS
The predictive power of ten ML methods was more than 70% (in accuracy, precision and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). According to the LASSO penalized logistic modelling, 10 of the 490 radiomic features selected as the associated features with SNHL status. All of the 10 features were statistically associated with SNHL (all of adjusted P-valuesâ€¯<â€¯.001).

The coordinate descent algorithm is a standard approach to solve the lasso which iteratively updates weights of predictors in a round-robin style until convergence. However, it has high computation cost. This paper proposes Sling, a fast approach to the lasso. It achieves high efficiency by skipping unnecessary updates for the predictors whose weight is zero in the iterations. Sling can obtain high prediction accuracy with fewer predictors than the standard approach. Experiments show that Sling can enhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of the lasso.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yasuhiro Fujiwara"", ids = ""144841089""); list(name = ""Yasutoshi Ida"", ids = ""1719865""); list(name = ""Hiroaki Shiokawa"", ids = ""38738753""); list(name = ""Sotetsu Iwamura"", ids = ""3382187"")",cb51606f9d6345f187a2440c6bd8ebebb15825d6; 2148a906b30147621f98f08c0bd1ce100f9a7870; 769b3fd1797859c9de6a3a183c1495de57b3bbd4; d58b672ff701a177603cccf2a43d97e2548884ec; 2c3fb8290402f9a1d6a1e2da9a2cbf503da1beca; a21ef3d0d142de028009b822c57c38f98d3fbe33; 04eb0de79106570082001dc2957fad9f0e6b2ef2; ec975f959cc47a78dffc22d0219f3bf0b95de80e; 88cdb017c39432b89ae947d5354b6d12edf1e22f; 577d4d39a7f287853b24cb4a987e1b8b59c3e64d,,,,1561-1567
8a0dbcd1c5b4322a940102e52939e9f424f269f4,Forecasting Lake Waikaremoana Water Availability for Hydro Power,"Lake Waikaremoana is a high-altitude, large-volume lake located within the rugged terrain of the Urewera National Park. At the lake outflow a rapid elevation change of nearly 450 metres in 8 kilometres facilitates the lakeâ€™s use as the upper intake portal for the Waikaremoana Hydro Power Scheme. At the time of this study, Genesis Energy operated the Waikaremoana Power Scheme in response to a water availability model based on daily lake level differencing from which daily generation capacity is predicted, allowing strategic bidding into the electricity market. However, when river flows are low this model is subject to error, as small changes in lake level sometimes cannot be determined accurately beyond background noise on daily timescales.

This project develops a method of estimating both current day and day-ahead water availability of Lake Waikaremoana, independent of lake levels using simple hydrological models, thereby improving operational efficiency of the Waikaremoana Power Scheme. The forecasting is developed specifically for the lower inflow conditions when the lake level differencing approach is most error prone.

It has long been recognised that a significant volume of Lake Waikaremoana water leaks through the ancient landslide dam which created the lake. Previous to this study, it was considered that an inaccurate estimation of this leakage rate combined with evaporative losses might contribute to the error within the existing water availability model. A modified catchment water balance and simple regression approach was applied to Lake Waikaremoana to estimate the lake water loss not accounted for by recorded outflows. Estimating this unrecorded loss translates to estimating the intercept of a linear regression relation, where the assumption is made that there is a linear relationship between the discharge of the Aniwaniwa Stream and the net lake water balance (excluding known outflows) under low inflow conditions. On the basis of the confidence intervals about the intercept, the balance term (constant background lake inflow minus leakage and evaporative loss) is estimated to within the range of 2.89 and -1.17 mÂ³s-Â¹ suggesting that the unknown portion of leakage and evaporative losses are not significant contributors to model error. A useful consequence of the regression was that regression coefficients could be used as a means of upscaling to give net lake storage change for low-flow conditions. This enabled day-ahead water availability forecasts to be acquired from Aniwaniwa Stream discharge day-ahead forecasts.

Two forecasting methodologies are developed to forecast the Aniwaniwa Stream discharge: a finite mixture rainfall-runoff model, and a multiple linear regression method. The rainfall-runoff model is formulated initially as a many-parameter model which is then subjected to a lasso-based model simplification concurrent with model calibration. The simplified model forecasts next-day inflows by using a weighted linear combination of hydrograph forms which best match the previous observedâ€¦",2011,Environmental Science,"list(name = ""Carrie Louise Hopkirk"", ids = ""103728128"")",ebd539bac366ecd1e0074539b8fffaa9130de4db; 43087e5320f1cfdd41e412a938e057cb757b083e,aad294b67a819b1595c8f57305acc634609faa0e; d767abc43e4ea5c39ab62c4c889c25e1a337529c; 1bec25fe6262751ccc33f6bf68b793121af4365c; bddae8c492a8c482d137379be05a3e5ab371e6c6; ce61347968ebf3ca81ce91dc0e001f9b7d93c3ee; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e2dc6c3934a65b3577d7659198eca180354c745a; 68328c580f417e2b7e4bfe6490f5d836154f060e; 13aba0306bcdd8876a35d26065692302cfa59cf7; e63b3dd28f12efcb22a0fc5c5d4facbc74149877; 5f25406e81eb1c69d8327c0213dcf33991fe9202; da6b4ffb382f2feda20259519cdfdd968636af50; ef42238dcac30dee34f4406b249e6bfb5ddd1440; 6a76765c7d4569ea2208433b2e1dbdde2d00a6e3; 920382338e33174739e661145b32a2d9ce3b08c8; abd4e69bab4d022052e0bfb9a461f6feb149ce3e; 767b2faa01e55150dec8dc274d2f123ac489e278; 11f853761b610c141e245260431b6bf25a0d4539; 9e4a647b3c8b3bec3d186c4df80d963eb64100fd; 74c24ac58f24f409d6ab0201f35b0f1372fbfcf8; ea8460ef8ac20b39bcdb2691e6bfd6c097e5fe7c,,,
01a4d0b219db8fbfcc2c561ecf47ef6d85ebad91,Palynology of Triassicâ€“Jurassic boundary sections in northern Switzerland,"A first palynostratigraphic scheme of Upper Triassic deposits in northern Switzerland was established based on spore-pollen associations and dinoflagellate cyst records from the upper part of the Upper Triassic Klettgau Formation and the lower part of the Lower Jurassic Staffelegg Formation. Drill cores from the Adlerberg region (Basel Tabular Jura) and from Weiach (northern part of Canton Zurich) as well as from an outcrop at the Chilchzimmersattel (Basel Folded Jura) were studied and five informal palynological associations are distinguished. These palynological associations correlate with palynological association of the Central European Epicontinental Basin and the Tethyan realm and provide a stratigraphic framework for the uppermost Triassic sediments in northern Switzerland. Throughout the uppermost Triassic to Jurassic palynological succession a remarkable prominence of Classopollis spp. is observed. Besides Classopollis spp. the three Rhaetian palynological associations A to C from the Upper Triassic Belchen Member include typical Rhaetian spore-pollen and dinoflagellate taxa (e.g., Rhaetipollis germanicus, Geopollis zwolinskae, Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, and Dapcodinium priscum). Association B differs from association A in a higher relative abundance of the sporomorph taxa Perinopollenites spp. and the consistent occurrence of Granuloperculatipollis rudis and Ricciisporites tuberculatus. Spore diversity is highest in the late Rhaetian palynological association C and includes Polypodiisporites polymicroforatus. A Rhaetian age for the Belchen Member is confirmed by palynological associations Aâ€“C, but there is no record of the latest Rhaetian and the earliest Jurassic. In contrast to the Rhaetian palynological associations the Early Jurassic associations W and D include Pinuspollenites spp., Trachysporites fuscus (in association W), and Ischyosporites variegatus. In the view of the end-Triassic mass extinction and contemporaneous environmental changes the described palynofloral succession represents the pre-extinction phase (associations A and B) including a distinct transgression, the extinction phase (association C) associated with a regression, and the post-extinction phase (association W).",2017,Geology,"list(name = ""Elke Schneebeli-Hermann"", ids = ""1422225859""); list(name = ""Nathan Looser"", ids = ""81291725""); list(name = ""Peter A.

Historically, the focus of these has often been cost effectiveness or cost utility, while other criteria were considered informally. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in the formal incorporation of additional criteria using multi-criteria decision analysis. Such an approach has not yet formally been part of decision-making policy in Ireland.ObjectiveThe objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that cost effectiveness is not the only criterion influencing reimbursement decisions in Ireland. Furthermore, the aim is to reveal criteria that may have informally influenced reimbursement decisions in the past.MethodsA list of potential criteria was identified based on the literature, national guidelines and experience of the national HTA agency. Information on each of these criteria was sought for every assessment conducted in Ireland up to July 2015. A logistic regression was fitted to the data to identify influential parameters. Model selection was performed using the Bolasso method.ResultsThirteen criteria were considered in the analysis. Two members of the HTA review team assessed the performance of the interventions against these criteria. Model selection suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and quality of evidence could be important drivers of reimbursement recommendations in Ireland. Less important drivers suggested include the year of assessment, the level of uncertainty, as well as safety and tolerability.ConclusionThe analysis demonstrates that recommendations for or against the reimbursement of technologies in Ireland are not only driven by cost effectiveness. This highlights the need for more formal inclusion of criteria in the process, to improve transparency and ensure consistency.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Susanne Schmitz"", ids = ""48541602""); list(name = ""Laura McCullagh"", ids = ""4687137""); list(name = ""RÃ³isÃ­n Adams"", ids = ""39081825""); list(name = ""Michael R.

ba3a41f3e14e37445b819758afe8de8d448b1e64,Environmental influences on patterns of larval replenishment in coral reef fishes,"Spatial and temporal patterns of larval replenishment to the San Blas Archipelago were measured using 3 light traps in each of 3 habitats (exposed, lagoon and back-reef) over 18 lunar months from December 1996 to June 1998. Traps were sampled for 19 consecutive nights centred on the new moon in each month. The effects of environmental variables (wind speed and wind direction, tidal range, rainfall, solar radiation and water temperature) on catches were examined both in the days immediately prior to settlement and during the entire larval phase using 2 approaches. Firstly, time-series analyses were used to compare night-to-night patterns in light trap catches of 11 species (Astrapogon puncticulatus, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Lutjanus apodus, L. mahogani, Ophioblen- nius atlanticus, Stegastes dorsopunicans, S. partitus, S. planifrons Synodontidae spp., Thalassoma bifasciatum and an unidentified blenny) with environmental variables. Secondly, modified correla- tion analysis was used to examine the relationships between environmental variables, averaged over larval durations, and light trap catches of 6 of these species. Time-series analysis detected significant correlations between catches of 8 species and wind direction; however, correlations were often weak and variable in direction. Similarly, there were weak correlations between day-to-day catches of all but 3 species and water temperature. Modified correlation analysis also found that water temperature was correlated with catches of 4 species (Lutjanus mahogani, Stegastes dorsopunicans, S. partitus and S. planifrons).

0a902831ad7135422b32845b0941f36e12adf520,Some Sparse Methods for High Dimensional Data,"High dimensional data means that the number of variables p is far larger than the number of observations n . This occurs in several fields such as genomic data or chemometrics. When p>n the OLS estimator does not exist for linear regression. Since it is a case of forced multicollinearity, one may use regularized methods such as ridge regression, principal component regression or PLS regression: these methods provide rather robust estimates through a dimension reduction approach or constraints on the regression coefficients. The fact that all the predictors are kept may be considered as a positive point in some cases. However if p>>n, it becomes a drawback since a combination of thousands of variables cannot be interpreted. Sparse combinations, ie with a large number of zero coefficients are preferred. Lasso, elastic net, sPLS perform simultaneously regularization and variable selection thanks to non quadratic penalties: L1, SCAD etc. Group-lasso is a generalization fitted to the case where explanatory variables are structured in blocks. Recent works include sparse discriminant analysis and sparse canonical correlation analysis. In PCA, the singular value decomposition shows that if we regress principal components onto the input variables, the vector of regression coefficients is equal to the factor loadings. It suffices to adapt sparse regression techniques to get sparse versions of PCA. Sparse Multiple Correspondence Analysis is derived from group-lasso with groups of indicator variables. Finally when one has a large number of observations, it is frequent that unobserved heterogeneity occurs, which means that there is no single model, but several local models: one for each cluster of a latent variable. Clusterwise methods optimize simultaneously the partition and the local models; they have been already extended to PLS regression. We will present here CS-PLS (Clusterwise Sparse PLS) a combination of clusterwise PLS and sPLS which is well fitted for big data: large n , large p.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gilbert Saporta"", ids = ""2866252"")",,,,,
9f84922bbfebce452b40a5281256448f1b336d9f,Clinical prediction of thrombectomy eligibility: A systematic review and 4-item decision tree,"Background A clinical large anterior vessel occlusion (LAVO)-prediction scale could reduce treatment delays by allocating intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT)-eligible patients directly to a comprehensive stroke center. Aim To subtract, validate and compare existing LAVO-prediction scales, and develop a straightforward decision support tool to assess IAT-eligibility. Methods We performed a systematic literature search to identify LAVO-prediction scales. Performance was compared in a prospective, multicenter validation cohort of the Dutch acute Stroke study (DUST) by calculating area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC). With group lasso regression analysis, we constructed a prediction model, incorporating patient characteristics next to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) items. Finally, we developed a decision tree algorithm based on dichotomized NIHSS items. Results We identified seven LAVO-prediction scales. From DUST, 1316 patients (35.8% LAVO-rate) from 14 centers were available for validation. FAST-ED and RACE had the highest AUROC (both >0.81, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01 for comparison with other scales). Group lasso analysis revealed a LAVO-prediction model containing seven NIHSS items (AUROC 0.84). With the GACE (Gaze, facial Asymmetry, level of Consciousness, Extinction/inattention) decision tree, LAVO is predicted (AUROC 0.76) for 61% of patients with assessment of only two dichotomized NIHSS items, and for all patients with four items. Conclusion External validation of seven LAVO-prediction scales showed AUROCs between 0.75 and 0.83. Most scales, however, appear too complex for Emergency Medical Services use with prehospital validation generally lacking. GACE is the first LAVO-prediction scale using a simple decision tree as such increasing feasibility, while maintaining high accuracy.

8757bd7e06c54647fae672941ddb40ca9a97c91f,Inference on average treatment effects in aggregate panel data settings,"This paper studies inference on treatment effects in aggregate panel data settings with a single treated unit and many control units. We propose new methods for making inference on average treatment effects in settings where both the number of pre-treatment and the number of post-treatment periods are large. We use linear models to approximate the counterfactual mean outcomes in the absence of the treatment. The counterfactuals are estimated using constrained Lasso, an essentially tuning free regression approach that nests difference-in-differences and synthetic control as special cases. We propose a $K$-fold cross-fitting procedure to remove the bias induced by regularization. To avoid the estimation of the long run variance, we construct a self-normalized $t$-statistic. The test statistic has an asymptotically pivotal distribution (a student $t$-distribution with $K-1$ degrees of freedom), which makes our procedure very easy to implement. Our approach has several theoretical advantages. First, it does not rely on any sparsity assumptions. Second, it is fully robust against misspecification of the linear model. Third, it is more efficient than difference-in-means and difference-in-differences estimators. The proposed method demonstrates an excellent performance in simulation experiments, and is taken to a data application, where we re-evaluate the economic consequences of terrorism.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Victor Chernozhukov"", ids = ""26331346""); list(name = ""Kaspar WÃ¼thrich"", ids = ""51116158""); list(name = ""Yinchu Zhu"", ids = ""10170636"")",fcf824fb1435a7b7affd5a7ebb3320e6b18db028; 4ca3082af373f1323f80531b1bb76574c52f518d; ffebfe3798242d917df6cfb5a0f0bfb77cf47a88; 8a174f29ebf1f24878f1c855d769c40256b9d909,437bef83ed7794a92d55b8d94a859f55eed51d86; fe1d480d577dfed1306ef99becba578cdb520a60; d64e2a9498ff73c11b1a51b348df8db30df7f416; 99b4201b3264f3cdad9ceda7294ec8ad534cb63d; 4241c25b3b8089a0b9baca05b2e6ecdaf4a42022; 43b586b7b653bd8115e84c31af42ca8098c77367; 956bc66f0043962b8e057f57652f3cd336eeb72d; ef8d3a3a0b9d75ab918f8da7e4a4343e9e50efba; 276be991dd62a963a46ebd83cd05fc431c0ac322; 6c0816db531371a1a5b5871d2a89c62ed4e7a505; fc5db714f0126e38f89f3e92cf67e0ff848f55d9; efd3605ea229d6804e616b6af34becff2dac904e; 40166988d84c7e9867b11facf5cfbcd73df18437; bf48eb31a4dde96e8050bb97996ca02a488a1124; 0c738fdfa27450e6f35b963335db02f20f4bf687; 8c2c1be3b6530d3d94bd4b3283d9a4f0de6f0e13; ece5045d0f495834b25d2188735bcee982edd8c2; d38e40481ccebc43c9c2e50b1739f2c951a7e368; 545122e2990590524459ec9b59ccac6ce71e3b6a; fbf99e5562a0780856e7c4ed615ab2ab66c0dff3; 5de3ed893d55624f87405c6a1601aeb51c372afc; 605973926515415ff208cda4e52c3c02b136932d; a83e9272fe67d617368a22bbfddc43a9654e270b; 52c0923580f5cb13fd165eb42f9dfd64be7e96ca; 15a57477504246f26d124ec4ea143449a7fb46ce; c31c87c591a25c64fbaa82e8ac6a81831b6ac7ce; fe86c9ef608d5cd33c496d182879192287cf8569; ca5cf32b8357d8209eb9ea31d1018f924565a37f; c89cec14e26cb94a5e0acb7048295f9ce72553cf; 53445cafa0393a343b1d16fdf2950cc80f34e4de; 8500d524dd0a09446e389cd709e264d7f6b4ba04; 45f875c9d146094a75093f03b8e2a90a31ebee92; e716688ddc25dcc8871ef04c7f864063949aa8b9; 94324e25f7a67c714da808f4dd375949ce614a65; b35e52b9a37a3cae02ef13f7fe8990afef3dc35c,,,

We consider a high-dimensional logistic regression and propose two different penalties: group spline-penalty or group smooth-penalty to handle the group structures of the time-dependent variables in the model. The new methods have the advantage for the situation where the model coefficients are sparse but change smoothly within the group, compared with other existing methods such as the group lasso and the group bridge approaches. Our methods are easy to implement since they can be turned into a group minimax concave penalty problem after certain transformations.

c6ac0376a92aac44910fcd4ebd6f41ebf84d0424,Correlates of Adjuvant Therapy Attitudes in African American Breast Cancer Patients.,"PURPOSE
Black breast cancer patients delay and underutilize adjuvant breast cancer therapies; yet, very few studies have specifically examined Black women's attitudes toward breast cancer therapy. This study observed the influence of self-reported interpersonal processes of care (e.g. self-efficacy) clinical and sociodemographic factors and sociocultural (e.g. religiosity), related to Black breast cancer patients' attitudes toward radiation and systemic therapies (chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy - ""AET"").


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of data from the Narrowing Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006-2011). The analysis included 210 Black women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed between independent variables (e.g., demographics) and three outcome variables (chemotherapy, AET, and radiation therapy) to asses women's perceptions of therapy type. The lasso method was used to select variables correlated with therapy attitudes.


RESULTS
Most women reported negative attitudes toward AET (56%) and radiation (54%); fewer negative attitudes were observed toward chemotherapy (47%). Higher education and greater perceived susceptibility of a recurrence were associated with more positive attitudes toward chemotherapy. Regarding radiation therapy, women with greater patient satisfaction were more likely to have more positive attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study findings may aid in the development of behavioral interventions targeted to mitigate Black women breast cancer treatment disparities. We found modifiable factors (e.g. communication, satisfaction ratings) that support opportunities for clinicians to better address Black women's needs regarding adjuvant treatment options. The development of tailored interventions for newly diagnosed Black breast cancer patients on patient related factors in health care are warranted for Black women with lower educational levels.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Megan C.

In such a situation, the group Lasso is an at- tractive method for variable selection since it promotes sparsity of the groups. We study the sensitivity of any group Lasso solution to the observations and provide its precise local parameterization. When the noise is Gaussian, this allows us to derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of the group Lasso. This result holds true for any fixed design, no matter whether it is under- or overdetermined. With these results at hand, various model selec- tion criteria, such as the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), are readily available which can provide an objectively guided choice of the optimal group Lasso fit.",2012,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Samuel Vaiter"", ids = ""3310559""); list(name = ""Charles-Alban Deledalle"", ids = ""2262533""); list(name = ""Gabriel PeyrÃ©"", ids = ""145481009""); list(name = ""Mohamed-Jalal Fadili"", ids = ""144812306""); list(name = ""Charles Dossal"", ids = ""2219084"")",c98ee6aee15ca6ad970cf327014a61caa74763e8; 117fddad6bcc1468ccafe89c17dcf37084640b13; 5f18458702e8b0dafa59edcd4e4e2c7981d95cab; 49d3e667f10adf685a015616a0909a26b183aae7; ae97f77b3c2d72c23b37d8bcd5a749265ab38b2c; e6ddabdb165d1ce85a8b80f826e4e84d82128aa7; d68fdcd96cc4b9414d57a3f7217595490daf484b; 38302b2a351e1588157f602eb852e45c8c31dd55; f64ab233c40d37a5fd4dbdd57374be69173b7cf6,d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 8a501aaf2c52210eea45e1786b41233d6b62c774; cc2d97b32aafa46184440d81b2b37eac703db796; 3424286d6d39de51080ddd683646565545d015e2; dcbfed708df1ea92ce3b01fc12e3f01e6ecdbb10; f603e9476b6613e4f36c5848902a17b3af19e1cb; 5db89746b77118f1f6c65f2b47d4074bcba55fa9; 021bea68871304493cbb68ebdd91dba4d0155bab; dc423c0563ac6c80ae8af840c8560438644a0e59; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 9ce8189786118f5795779d894307e6752f90d95e; 61f53054eecddcca3f78915e70c62aa80af1ec8f; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; db31973871f5648cffb02e7590582376e16ad0bb; 77f4f0f1de8e80afc0fe0591ddd4bf3d52098329; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 8d647886ad63f37bfc671c19c2d3b70e995adb89; bc14819e745cd7af37efd09ea29773dc0065119e; abc45baef4cd2d66bd8b069ef74726bc08570047; cbaf5ea0b865bcbecd0d3ce59866332051a01422; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; 7e1ce7efcb0fa493d19feb8333c76293410ce90f; 5214b65ed56efffd97493a59114a772dfb54caf1,ArXiv,abs/1212.6478,

b9b6656ff04168273a094f562f27b00ca0ec1169,Predicting Suicide Attempts and Suicide Deaths Following Outpatient Visits Using Electronic Health Records.,"OBJECTIVE:
The authors sought to develop and validate models using electronic health records to predict suicide attempt and suicide death following an outpatient visit.


METHOD:
Across seven health systems, 2,960,929 patients age 13 or older (mean age, 46 years; 62% female) made 10,275,853 specialty mental health visits and 9,685,206 primary care visits with mental health diagnoses between Jan. 1, 2009, and June 30, 2015. Health system records and state death certificate data identified suicide attempts (N=24,133) and suicide deaths (N=1,240) over 90 days following each visit. Potential predictors included 313 demographic and clinical characteristics extracted from records for up to 5 years before each visit: prior suicide attempts, mental health and substance use diagnoses, medical diagnoses, psychiatric medications dispensed, inpatient or emergency department care, and routinely administered depression questionnaires. Logistic regression models predicting suicide attempt and death were developed using penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) variable selection in a random sample of 65% of the visits and validated in the remaining 35%.


RESULTS:
Mental health specialty visits with risk scores in the top 5% accounted for 43% of subsequent suicide attempts and 48% of suicide deaths. Of patients scoring in the top 5%, 5.4% attempted suicide and 0.26% died by suicide within 90 days. C-statistics (equivalent to area under the curve) for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.851 (95% CI=0.848, 0.853) and 0.861 (95% CI=0.848, 0.875), respectively. Primary care visits with scores in the top 5% accounted for 48% of subsequent suicide attempts and 43% of suicide deaths. C-statistics for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.853 (95% CI=0.849, 0.857) and 0.833 (95% CI=0.813, 0.853), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS:
Prediction models incorporating both health record data and responses to self-report questionnaires substantially outperform existing suicide risk prediction tools.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory E.

In this paper the SGL is introduced to the quantile regression (QR) framework, and a more flexible version, the adaptive sparse group LASSO (ASGL), is proposed. This proposal adds weights to the penalization improving prediction accuracy. Usually, adaptive weights are taken as a function of the original non-penalized solution model. This approach is only feasible in the n > p framework. In this work, a solution that allows using adaptive weights in high-dimensional scenarios is proposed.

7f719980b8cfc9b466ef460dbdb6947a83a3a19f,Genomic prediction of breeding values for carcass traits in Nellore cattle,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions for rib eye area (REA), backfat thickness (BFT), and hot carcass weight (HCW) in Nellore beef cattle from Brazilian commercial herds using different prediction models.MethodsPhenotypic data from 1756 Nellore steers from ten commercial herds in Brazil were used. Animals were offspring of 294 sires and 1546 dams, reared on pasture, feedlot finished, and slaughtered at approximately 2Â years of age. All animals were genotyped using a 777k Illumina Bovine HD SNP chip. Accuracy of genomic predictions of breeding values was evaluated by using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme and considering three models: Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), Bayes C (BC) and Bayesian Lasso (BL), and two types of response variables: traditional estimated breeding value (EBV), and phenotype adjusted for fixed effects (Y*).ResultsThe prediction accuracies achieved with the BRR model were equal to 0.25 (BFT), 0.33 (HCW) and 0.36 (REA) when EBV was used as response variable, and 0.21 (BFT), 0.37 (HCW) and 0.46 (REA) when using Y*. Results obtained with the BC and BL models were similar. Accuracies increased for traits with a higher heritability, and using Y* instead of EBV as response variable resulted in higher accuracy when heritability was higher.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the accuracy of genomic prediction of carcass traits in Nellore cattle is moderate to high. Prediction of genomic breeding values from adjusted phenotypes Y* was more accurate than from EBV, especially for highly heritable traits. The three models considered (BRR, BC and BL) led to similar predictive abilities and, thus, either one could be used to implement genomic prediction for carcass traits in Nellore cattle.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gerardo Alves Fernandes JÃºnior"", ids = ""4262607""); list(name = ""Guilherme J.

744eb4cbd3f4cd26030fa2a1dda467e23157dd4c,Urban Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Group Lasso,"The growing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in urban areas raises multiple reliability issues. The topology reconstruction is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and network topology reconstruction are hard in distribution grids. The reasons are that 1) the branches are challenging and expensive to monitor due to underground setup; 2) the inappropriate assumption of radial topology in many studies that urban grids are mesh. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new data-driven approach to reconstruct distribution grid topology by utilizing the newly available smart meter data. Specifically, a graphical model is built to model the probabilistic relationships among different voltage measurements. With proof, the bus connectivity and topology estimation problems are formulated as a linear regression problem with least absolute shrinkage on grouped variables (Group Lasso) to deal with meshed network structures. Simulation results show highly accurate estimation in IEEE standard distribution test systems with and without loops using real smart meter data.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yizheng Liao"", ids = ""4686487""); list(name = ""Yang Weng"", ids = ""2221471""); list(name = ""Guangyi Liu"", ids = ""2718270""); list(name = ""Ram Rajagopal"", ids = ""2515457"")",c90eadae5071681dce1e1e93325cbdca1d396da2; 8fd9f71d95e481d0fb3db5fdeeef0cafe6202a00; 4d3ba549c033902b3b5a42b0485695e62b8f68fa; 44f84247f3881d7b4671007ad357ae21a9166bf3; 27a7e900b22092ddc10fdc4da37c05290dd56862; c8ef115bab16c792a8c3e4ab411065c09e292875; 2190d239680ea48f49ac0769c2a332093089993e; a0915b6041be671a4d1f174fa7a36cd961f47a80; 018e8a9bb3337e5ba5a3385f5a4cc54b9f871c23; 5f4bbd10639a40674b9ca62e5cde12a48e892eec,d024f1a4185eeeb5f3553ce1a1128331dd2b44de; 00b7f44857676600805172e99be6f9f2987e98eb; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 41a402c933f2372f5ada49b690c9de5ed7524025; 88d9ed51d8bf9c230052dcadad0b675588e46981; 6b63d7d5ee04993824014207e43c27708262be1e; f091b68db289dbe08d8483c4ecf47edf8a4b89ac; 58209c6db7b321ea7c75395b23ddb5100cd9bf81; 015cf476a95c0199e8a8a8e3dbd39d6571b9b319; 95fe4e7097ea525125fed22ecf8b68805aa7c2ce; 4f48b6a243edc297f1e282e34c255d5029403116; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; ec572c02fad95a319a29c2ebd18ae42790cd1b1d; 799258bc950a72840c98b09cbaa9e0ff0533b478; a03add746ebaea4be7261686beedf39b97ffc456; 636ede7021dd62dd4a21955e47ac6c2c95b19899; 5de14b7785fef13da6abb2e9defae999e4201f00; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b11f836d7c3b682044d7305c7443b321834e1dc6; af045ba2db8869ccf27a5c19e3118d930a07973b; c7028d284b08e3c5aaf35ed8327b07c37b182086; bd9866d9230b72fde302fccdd6992bd048a12f12; 31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5; b6d35f1d38abf86b0f2993910c845cbab6a01d36; fc52ce9c36dd675c6bc07606dd318cca1786f39b,ArXiv,abs/1611.01845,
