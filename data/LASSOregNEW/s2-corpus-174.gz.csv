c87bc8e1f5beab3b474df28f10d1a5774c9759ef,Natural Language or Not (NLoN) - A Package for Software Engineering Text Analysis Pipeline,"The use of natural language processing (NLP) is gaining popularity in software engineering. In order to correctly perform NLP, we must pre-process the textual information to separate natural language from other information, such as log messages, that are often part of the communication in software engineering. We present a simple approach for classifying whether some textual input is natural language or not. Although our NLoN package relies on only 11 language features and character tri-grams, we are able to achieve an area under the ROC curve performances between 0.976-0.987 on three different data sources, with Lasso regression from Glmnet as our learner and two human raters for providing ground truth. Cross-source prediction performance is lower and has more fluctuation with top ROC performances from 0.913 to 0.980. Compared with prior work, our approach offers similar performance but is considerably more lightweight, making it easier to apply in software engineering text mining pipelines. Our source code and data are provided as an R-package for further improvements.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mika MÃ¤ntylÃ¤"", ids = ""144811716""); list(name = ""Fabio Calefato"", ids = ""1810643""); list(name = ""MaÃ«lick Claes"", ids = ""2002057"")",232c709244b3739be5f78e981857ae56f6c47d9d; c26972c8f3a8a5b933d4888c4366fbd45d9cd58b; cd3370b044217e32e2753cba6597df6094de4603; dbd07904c9d2f2c8b7a0c040f2bf52fdb5df569f,6a97303b92477d95d1e6acf7b443ebe19a6beb60; f51019367bf584485547f6b90a9444f270d07b38; a75965753906c24a6a5715a695757a0de8447f26; 93ed9f68791824e60163ec582f5ef638e1980ccb; acfb0cdb75695064148b427005d88b6aa51994f6; 63b8ebfe57af400c8bbadc5c111cb5fe71f331bd; 8c673ec90030f74a40044a008ed75275ab26ae56; 85d727b119304dde458bcd8cf5cb87a906fb41ba; 63408b8f964ca231b83c2f8b0f7904d6acf17e16; 3cfd7adad23ff9ab8985ffc70f27d6946a6252ff; c4edffba3966577a728c9547c9936d9b421229d1; a1a48f7cf7eff908ac9239b2be4bc39f79ef6e47; 187e90cab6339b3c99bc17d9a236de126b81a2f8; 95eafdf9c39d4c87a5ca0973bcdd08c149ad56e4; 1a3a904d0d865043135a53ba59f1f613fa2be3f3; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 3fb416be9e59b35c7cc91cd11b5b3f3f5491f13a; d54d56b99d63afbeb69af95dc4ede26c2ff12e54; 80567fa91680d60f6ec0921a5a795328d689fb92,2018 IEEE/ACM 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR),,387-391
2ecd6a1677849ad6d1805178443a2d2968a808eb,Development of a preprocedure nomogram for predicting contrast-induced acute kidney injury after coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention,"Most of the risk models for predicting contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) are available for postcontrast exposure prediction, thus have limited values in practice. We aimed to develop a novel nomogram based on preprocedural features for early prediction of CI-AKI in patients after coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 245 patients were retrospectively reviewed from January 2015 to January 2017. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression model was applied to select most strong predictors for CI-AKI. The CI-AKI risk score was calculated for each patient as a linear combination of selected predictors that were weighted by their respective coefficients. The discrimination of nomogram was assessed by C-statistic. The occurrence of CI-AKI was 13.9% (34 out of 245). We identified ten predictors including sex, diabetes mellitus, lactate dehydrogenase level, C-reactive protein, years since drinking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), stage of CKD, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and systolic blood pressure. The CI-AKI prediction nomogram obtained good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.718, 95%CI: 0.637-0.800, p = 7.23 Ã— 10-5). The cutoff value of CI-AKI risk score was -1.953. Accordingly, the novel nomogram we developed is a simple and accurate tool for preprocedural prediction of CI-AKI in patients undergoing CAG or PCI.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bao-liang Guo"", ids = ""5963625""); list(name = ""Fu-sheng Ouyang"", ids = ""19403851""); list(name = ""Shao-ming Yang"", ids = ""49080691""); list(name = ""Zi-wei Liu"", ids = ""49293505""); list(name = ""Shao-Jia Lin"", ids = ""20295256""); list(name = ""Wei Meng"", ids = ""46298149""); list(name = ""Xi-yi Huang"", ids = ""47932992""); list(name = ""Li-Zhu Ouyang"", ids = ""67076743""); list(name = ""Hai-Xiong Chen"", ids = ""27600139""); list(name = ""Qiu-Gen Hu"", ids = ""4953387"")",1a96067de97fe47e1d01c45c037744aaa2fa7750; b115fbd8495d76bc32249cdf85b8583961c0a214; 08412617bfcc6e2f094a6e6785ee5e3fe02129a9,859dd1572b9383c31a7f2aeadbabfd16a8b97070; 87dc62ecef4296778edda3a92a53502eab8b6ede; 51783bb92bc09bd417a81bc9b64c4172ce82edfd; beb85fabebe43fd3b057c6042146e675e42e1770; 67e7d870b215ae2035fe242df6a49251f2bcf272; 12a780e709468c1666d10bf082757ce26c8070aa; 5e0b604fa3a74cde3990087483c7174dadebcb4e; bcf9ee127ada1eecc6a6a874464b55462a1f6bbc; fb391e05029790ec982f48771114e37b0ad7e0bf; d0959c071745f0e24d2e1802ff54dca7f7cbd6c7; 5d18deccd1c375a6f1015427ed631c6492a75411; 2319bee74433542b30c077f98ac03f645235828d; aa4420e82837888a0f0a5d27fd71b888a347914a; b680b59821c30fc11102c528c248337f6f8bd4ea; 7673be1624be11f1fe27a24a7132bb8bef0448b6; 37ff104e270ce3e02c3b3903bbb435834cb975f2; e87fb1100dd3dbff138e0712e5a8b30ede17261a; 8f8ab925dca8e5d57c39329fbf615f4199ff2d8e; 9d29f4bafc4be329e29b69eafa9377847fb67001; 48f682168002f286b468c492dcc665a9228d5e4f; 3d097346d951c8a801275af84a483c464b99b9de; 2cac80bc9407c4e427bfafc450edf4c15f0c14bf; 1f525ba2f782fa0b1a8d6c79eecc6dec6f17a144; 3b53e36b3225ea49cda1bf5272ae3fe4d1322a24; 57b355890e3cb569dfb05d32eadecf473426fbd4; a5bbc0af1f631410d6cbffd6f8cb8e777e8c1343; b817680aa8228297d19a235d7eb81f58a1ed3b6c,Oncotarget,8,75087 - 75093
23c6fb9fd983f14baf260536b3c11c26f45f10f0,A plea for taking all available clinical information into account when assessing the predictive value of omics data,"BackgroundOmics data can be very informative in survival analysis and may improve the prognostic ability of classical models based on clinical risk factors for various diseases, for example breast cancer. Recent research has focused on integrating omics and clinical data, yet has often ignored the need for appropriate model building for clinical variables. Medical literature on classical prognostic scores, as well as biostatistical literature on appropriate model selection strategies for low dimensional (clinical) data, are often ignored in the context of omics research. The goal of this paper is to fill this methodological gap by investigating the added predictive value of gene expression data for models using varying amounts of clinical information.MethodsWe analyze two data sets from the field of survival prognosis of breast cancer patients. First, we construct several proportional hazards prediction models using varying amounts of clinical information based on established medical knowledge. These models are then used as a starting point (i.e. included as a clinical offset) for identifying informative gene expression variables using resampling procedures and penalized regression approaches (model based boosting and the LASSO). In order to assess the added predictive value of the gene signatures, measures of prediction accuracy and separation are examined on a validation data set for the clinical models and the models that combine the two sources of information.ResultsFor one data set, we do not find any substantial added predictive value of the omics data when compared to clinical models. On the second data set, we identify a noticeable added predictive value, however only for scenarios where little or no clinical information is included in the modeling process. We find that including more clinical information can lead to a smaller number of selected omics predictors.ConclusionsNew research using omics data should include all available established medical knowledge in order to allow an adequate evaluation of the added predictive value of omics data. Including all relevant clinical information in the analysis might also lead to more parsimonious models. The developed procedure to assess the predictive value of the omics data can be readily applied to other scenarios.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander Volkmann"", ids = ""40159969""); list(name = ""Riccardo De Bin"", ids = ""8918253""); list(name = ""Willi Sauerbrei"", ids = ""32511206""); list(name = ""Anne-Laure Boulesteix"", ids = ""32416939"")",72f26181d3b442d27717e1ec96310220695ba731,63a13cfb7e4dc1fb0d680114c007dfbbf05aea23; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9; 10179d638070a2f2381f917aeb27768b76cbe3f2; 0fb7c1f96c92e08b84b0433cea53998489ce07bf; ea35d9684b8b9017268bf5092333a4475f12450a; e4cc161efeaa4fe1e6ea8272c05f8128b0df75d6; 8b935ce8f40b263d3220e27b2819543d690a5187; 4b58c106bc89dbfcdf5447e76ec267d59e35a15c; f59f26e58c3ef4e99b88122143ecb57bfd5a97d4; 2be5878a7ce90f313c8a67ddf280b20d7263dd05; e0095cd0217464553536c6ab17796069086bae31; da328318c510f6b8384d7f08c1f78532c4a23d04; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 7cafbf6ea89b077abbbd6a824e557b308c3e8292; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; 3467e34cae93c33c1be8c3dc0fa4a3a6405e18e3; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 882afba9521441445030c7f52edc91959aa6b956; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; 792c2bca3de92b9ffd5141e3fe473417e8692ce0; b2ab0b2201554f7d744dde7a78dbc7b30d706252; 165a7196bd6a30185e6155a0f4788da72cc3e73d; 4802cbcd88c56b05ab6b097f3d60fc8e6d70a1b0; daec4d29ff5ab05790f603de8f84216a3a6c357a; fd3c2af5f6f94f07db95a5b4dff163575bccec53; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; cf986ef388df2fa241b912d8fdbe8f61d8313b5d; 5dd134168c05921376ab873c816beb79f3596722; 4893b5105f5d708b305a873f82ccd1a93da45011; 91e2bf07848784d6feac15b8b900e784341bf9cc; 6c833d6a6afda25f6464aeebc85911e2fd20bf3a; a6d33daa0e093a50b1b58e3aa34191c4b5acda92; 57691c00a275c865b29e2614f24e8c1726d623a5; 336f111d91c8db2fdbda7810a2db7997c81fb49a; 9f2fdade852bb1b19b314689a907ad24c865f11d; 49bda01e28f3f9fffa4fa14bd909c0a2340aa066; 63cfc1b471288f1110c9ae0f5de164f56acc888e; 4ce673f5472fe6e10d7a3f781fc069f784dd08fe; 1f1cab14b55133ad7d43e813706cfc58cf32016d,BMC Medical Research Methodology,19,

810f39fee2ea4ba27ab948178ab11876565d03fe,Sparse Regression Based Structure Learning of Stochastic Reaction Networks from Single Cell Snapshot Time Series,"Stochastic chemical reaction networks constitute a model class to quantitatively describe dynamics and cell-to-cell variability in biological systems. The topology of these networks typically is only partially characterized due to experimental limitations. Current approaches for refining network topology are based on the explicit enumeration of alternative topologies and are therefore restricted to small problem instances with almost complete knowledge. We propose the reactionet lasso, a computational procedure that derives a stepwise sparse regression approach on the basis of the Chemical Master Equation, enabling large-scale structure learning for reaction networks by implicitly accounting for billions of topology variants. We have assessed the structure learning capabilities of the reactionet lasso on synthetic data for the complete TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling cascade comprising 70 reactions. We find that the reactionet lasso is able to efficiently recover the structure of these reaction systems, ab initio, with high sensitivity and specificity. With only < 1% false discoveries, the reactionet lasso is able to recover 45% of all true reactions ab initio among > 6000 possible reactions and over 102000 network topologies. In conjunction with information rich single cell technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry, the reactionet lasso will enable large-scale structure learning, particularly in areas with partial network structure knowledge, such as cancer biology, and thereby enable the detection of pathological alterations of reaction networks. We provide software to allow for wide applicability of the reactionet lasso.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna Klimovskaia"", ids = ""35929703""); list(name = ""Stefan Ganscha"", ids = ""7161378""); list(name = ""Manfred Claassen"", ids = ""3522545"")",ff02136d7ee54ca38d7f4012e5787596ac417159; 0dbb5e29057d803ddc36da2d1983e0bf1ff50013; acdfdfb2e25d1d17b7d9fd7aa909829e99187f37; 594ee97ca1fc552d368826116c2bdf49aed34879; 03cfb1b1006bd06e8d442d68b0d269aa2be5650c; c84920165fa5a4361a02394702318a014d9c8a72; 3aa9f6a4bb95097082f8e6bad1986e4e11aa9914,,PLoS Computational Biology,12,
04a933e98e230309a69ee5b0a8f4adb44ebd5cde,Spectral Deconfounding and Perturbed Sparse Linear Models,"Standard high-dimensional regression methods assume that the underlying coefficient vector is sparse. This might not be true in some cases, in particular in presence of hidden, confounding variables. Such hidden confounding can be represented as a high-dimensional linear model where the sparse coefficient vector is perturbed. We develop and investigate a class of methods for such model. We propose some spectral transformations, which change the singular values of the design matrix, as a preprocessing step for the data which serves as input for the Lasso.

ead80bdf7244dfdfa4f1ae3145438de90951739e,Automatic feed phase identification in multivariate bioprocess profiles by sequential binary classification.,"In this paper, we propose a new strategy for retrospective identification of feed phases from online sensor-data enriched feed profiles of an Escherichia Coli (E.Â coli) fed-batch fermentation process. In contrast to conventional (static), data-driven multi-class machine learning (ML), we exploit process knowledge in order to constrain our classification system yielding more parsimonious models compared to static ML approaches. In particular, we enforce unidirectionality on a set of binary, multivariate classifiers trained to discriminate between adjacent feed phases by linking the classifiers through a one-way switch. The switch is activated when the actual classifier output changes. As a consequence, the next binary classifier in the classifier chain is used for the discrimination between the next feed phase pair etc. We allow activation of the switch only after a predefined number of consecutive predictions of a transition event in order to prevent premature activation of the switch and undertake a sensitivity analysis regarding the optimal choice of the (time) lag parameter. From a complexity/parsimony perspective the benefit of our approach is three-fold: i) The multi-class learning task is broken down into binary subproblems which usually have simpler decision surfaces and tend to be less susceptible to the class-imbalance problem. ii) We exploit the fact that the process follows a rigid feed cycle structure (i.e. batch-feed-batch-feed) which allows us to focus on the subproblems involving phase transitions as they occur during the process while discarding off-transition classifiers and iii) only one binary classifier is active at the time which keeps effective model complexity low. We further use a combination of logistic regression and Lasso (i.e. regularized logistic regression, RLR) as a wrapper to extract the most relevant features for individual subproblems from the whole set of high-dimensional sensor data. We train different soft computing classifiers, including decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM) and an own developed fuzzy classifier and compare our method with conventional multi-class ML. Our results show a remarkable out-performance of the here proposed method over static ML approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. We achieved close to error free feed phase classification while reducing the misclassification rates in 17 out of 20 investigated test cases in the range between 39% and 98.2% depending on feature set and classifier architecture. Models trained on features based on selection by RLR significantly outperformed those trained on features suggested by experts and their predictive performance was considerably less affected by the choice of the lag parameter.",2017,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Ramin Nikzad-Langerodi"", ids = ""1398663584""); list(name = ""Edwin Lughofer"", ids = ""1689446""); list(name = ""Susanne Saminger-Platz"", ids = ""1398663599""); list(name = ""Thomas Zahel"", ids = ""39487994""); list(name = ""Patrick Sagmeister"", ids = ""98867810""); list(name = ""Christoph Herwig"", ids = ""30049575"")",,787ac5c8b4139c7c6ce1e85f6427d060fdf998ad; b7934f7d7e53d85f3bb05b2f013a8ff2bdfc0943; 79da73da264cb92b7811a0ff99e62493007f4901; d8d4d6db5b86694c7564ccd6edbe8b664cfb5f9f; 0126d512615b83f6dbbcdd5d15a587b6b2a333ba; 29e7db86cd48b33f4f89ec955981a0041e5c5d1f; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 5db32d709e9d0517ad3231793af488186111d4d0; 19a0fed3f73262f3ffe0027d7201769914da4315; d4f4348760d436f1cf7d1c456ecbdae8c94dcbdb; 7da6ba875916655ef03b4423b68b9e7b1b74eeb0; 69465edeb7eaa1e7862987839f177ff9afb52609; 273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1; 385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e; c1b0b4a66e79a8e63216ff4304406e60bbc15440; 2688c2a6f35e3cc26c4a67915f1cf3e4b47f2f5c; 151b72dc8400dab7d64f00844f6865e7529fb294; 80db408970c1b8d4ebb664ac313bf5c452f95671; 3d6f1c881deaad8190b9e6c0c57ad800f486624d; 1a8abc6726ef23960a32a36d80e446d89ef41a88; e86a8d142c0650cea8f7769f8844b347ce2bac6d; 85f57aa4b0bc3a443bbd076ed352106721f4a5cc; eeb82f464a9bab96579223ec1771ff1867fd8857; 5f3880cf2f353f26d6c7d8a7a94c70cc758741d3; 27eecf4b979779f43f5725292bf721b9eb359736; 8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6; 6b9c7fa924f86b7d802c742b1c05814086815963; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 7b28610d2d681a11398eb614de0d70d7de41c20c; b4d00a786ceb5a93c53867b843f3e1379fde5e02; 477ff004964e1f2d61e77edc56dde8a4b9b3e31c; 93ec1a03f8ba7e4aa3105619b9d0c2d343e68b1a,Analytica chimica acta,982,"

ff67836b02a1402aea9be8bcfa1b41f52903194e,Sample size determination for training cancer classifiers from microarray and RNA-seq data,"The objective of many high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq studies is to develop a classifier of cancer patients based on characteristics of their disease. The germinal center B-cell (GCB) classifier study in lymphoma and the National Cancer Institute's Director's Challenge lung (DC-lung) study are two examples. In recent years, such classifiers are often developed using regularized regression, such as the lasso. A critical question is whether a better classifier can be developed from a larger training set size and, if so, how large the training set should be. This paper examines these two questions using an existing sample size method and a novel sample size method developed here specifically for lasso logistic regression. Both methods are based on pilot data. We reexamine the lymphoma and lung cancer data sets to evaluate the sample sizes, and use resampling to assess the estimation methods. We also study application to an RNA-seq data set. We find that it is feasible to estimate sample size for regularized logistic regression if an adequate pilot data set exists. The GCB and the DC-lung data sets appear adequate, under specific assumptions. Existing human RNA-seq data sets are by and large inadequate, and cannot be used as pilot data. Pilot RNA-seq data can be simulated, and the methods in this paper can be used for sample size estimation.

cb0d7567e9db1020ecb7ced2dbf6f0b5a5787d37,A Comparative Study of Single-Trait and Multi-Trait Genomic Selection,"In recent years of animal and plant breeding research, genomic selection (GS) became a choice for selection of appropriate candidate for breeding as it significantly contributes to enhance the genetic gain. Various studies related to GS have been carried out in the recent past. These studies were mostly confined to single trait. Although GS methods based on single trait have not performed very well in cases like pleiotropy, missing data and when the trait under study has low heritability. Gradually, some studies were carried out to explore the possibility of methods for GS based on multiple traits in the view of overcoming the above-mentioned problems in the method of single-trait GS (STGS). Currently, multi-trait-based GS methods are getting importance as it exploits the information of correlated structure among response. In this study, we have compared various methods related to STGS, such as stepwise regression, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian, best linear unbiased prediction, and support vector machine, and multi-trait-based GS methods, such as multivariate regression with covariance estimation, conditional Gaussian graphical models, mixed model, and LASSO. In almost all cases, multi-trait-based methods are found to be more accurate. Based on the results of this study, it may be concluded that multi-trait-based methods have great potential to increase genetic gain as they utilize the correlation among the response variable as extra information, which contributes to estimate breeding value more precisely. This study is a comprehensive review of the methods of GS right from single trait to multiple traits and comparisons among these two classes.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Neeraj Budhlakoti"", ids = ""51311807""); list(name = ""D.

89092979cb6f2261716666651f54f9da979a0269,OEM for least squares problems,"We propose an algorithm, called OEM (a.k.a. orthogonalizing EM), intended for var- ious least squares problems. The first step, named active orthogonization, orthogonalizes an arbi- trary regression matrix by elaborately adding more rows. The second step imputes the responses of the new rows. The third step solves the least squares problem of interest for the complete orthog- onal design. The second and third steps have simple closed forms, and iterate until convergence. The algorithm works for ordinary least squares and regularized least squares with the lasso, SCAD, MCP and other penalties. It has several attractive theoretical properties. For the ordinary least squares with a singular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose gen- eralized inverse-based least squares estimator. For the SCAD and MCP, an OEM sequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations for a fixed or diverging number of variables. For ordinary and regularized least squares with various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having grouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. Convergence and convergence rate of the algorithm are examined. These convergence rate results show that for the same data set, OEM converges faster for regularized least squares than ordinary least squares. This provides a new theoretical comparison between these methods.

fc4152dc9e7b90a6a5726b4f786c5e0f7d499bc3,Accounting for spatial dependency in multivariate spectroscopic data,"We examine a hybrid multivariate regression technique to account for the spatial dependency in spectroscopic data due to adjacent measurement locations in the same joint by combining dimension reduction methods and linear mixed effects (LME) modeling. Spatial correlation is a common limitation (assumption of independence) encountered in diagnostic applications involving adjacent measurement locations, such as mapping of tissue properties, and can impede tissue evaluations. Near-infrared spectra were collected from equine joints (n = 5) and corresponding biomechanical (n = 202), compositional (n = 530), and structural (n = 530) properties of cartilage tissue were measured. Subsequently, hybrid regression models for estimating tissue properties from the spectral data were developed in combination with principal component analysis (PCA-LME) scores and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO-LME). Performance comparison of PCA-LME and principal component regression, and LASSO-LME and LASSO regression was conducted to evaluate the effects of spatial dependency. A systematic improvement in calibration modelsâ€™ correlation coefficients and a decrease in cross validation errors were observed when accounting for spatial dependency. Our results indicate that accounting for spatial dependency using a LME-based approach leads to more accurate prediction models.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mithilesh Prakash"", ids = ""32651270""); list(name = ""Jaakko K Sarin"", ids = ""6705821""); list(name = ""Lassi Rieppo"", ids = ""5763259""); list(name = ""Isaac O.

43e2f86ab0f14053b80ea7f59952026c9949fd0e,Analysis of Controls in ChIP-seq,"The chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) method, initially introduced a decade ago, is widely used by the scientific community to detect protein/DNA binding and histone modifications across the genome in various cell lines. Every experiment is prone to noise and bias, and ChIP-seq experiments are no exception. To alleviate bias, incorporation of control datasets in ChIP-seq analysis is an essential step. The controls are used to detect background signal, whilst the ChIP-seq experiment captures the true binding or histone modification signal. However, a recurrent issue is the existence of noise and bias in the controls themselves, as well as different types of bias in ChIP-seq experiments. Thus, depending on which controls are used, peak calling can produce different results (i.e., binding site positions) for the same ChIP-seq experiment. Consequently, generating ""smart"" controls, which model the non-signal effect for a specific ChIP-seq experiment, could enhance contrast and thus increase the reliability and reproducibility of the results. Our analysis aims to improve our understanding of ChIP-seq controls and their biases. We use unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to compare 160 controls for the K562 cell line in the ENCODE project, finding distincting groupings of controls which correlate to experimental characteristics. To customize a control for each ChIP-seq experiment, we use LASSO regression to fit a sparse set of controls to each of 500 ChIP-seq experiments (again, from ENCODE data for the K562 cell line). We look at how many controls are selected, which controls are used per ChIP-seq experiment, and how they are related to the different ChIP-seq experiment characteristics. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the LASSO models are not particularly sparse, often including half of the possible controls to model any given ChIP-seq. Cross-validation as well as testing with smaller sets of candidate controls proves that such large numbers of controls are beneficial for modeling ChIP-seq background distributions. We also observe clusters of ChIP-seq experiments that tend to rely on clusters of controls, and we look at the experimental characteristics that tend to cause a given control to be useful in modeling the background of a given ChIP-seq experiment. Through these analyses, we attempt to answer largely-unstudied questions regarding how much control data and of what types are useful in ChIP-seq analysis, and how suitable controls can be matched to ChIP-seq datasets.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aseel Awdeh"", ids = ""47763847""); list(name = ""Theodore J.

Our aim is to classify HCC into clinically/biologically relevant subtypes according to stromal factors. We detected seven types of stromal features in tumors from 161 HCC patients by immunohistochemical staining and Hematoxylin-eosin staining. Five stromal features were selected out of seven types of stromal features to construct stromal type based on LASSO COX regression model. Then, integrating multiple clinicopathologic characteristics and stromal type, we built two nomograms for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Further validation of the stromal type and nomograms were performed in the testing cohort (n = 160) and validation cohort (n = 120). Using the LASSO model, we classified HCC patients into stromal type A subgroup (CD34lowTIL-stromal-ratiohighStromal-tumor-ratiolowÎ±-SMAweakStromamature) and stromal type B subgroup (CD34highTIL-stromal-ratiolowStromal-tumor-ratiohighÎ±-SMAstrongStromaimmature). The stromal type was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in the training, testing and validation cohorts. Two nomograms (for OS and DFS) that integrated the stromal type and clinicopathologic risk factors also showed good predictive accuracy and discriminatory power. In addition, immune cell recruitment in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was conditioned by the tumor stromal type. In conclusion, the newly developed tumor stromal type was an effective predictor of OS and DFS. Furthermore, the stromal type is associated with the immune phenotype in the TME.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Li"", ids = ""50135588""); list(name = ""Jun Han"", ids = ""48691179""); list(name = ""Kefei Yuan"", ids = ""36824869""); list(name = ""Hong Wu"", ids = ""40019168"")",2cc08aefab5f118733d3e9bca206da9ec54ccad5,77489759640b3fa4dd5207f8ae2996c7cc7a2462; 3597ce358b17a29aa2ea268b06e7d30be79bd4a1; 0acd6a769ce74b978059c042990f8c3efc008844; e3ef800c7dd8bee678616c8927580b11d20a40b3; 440bfc0e1753df33f1ec0bc26925158131443aaa; e224e8bc385cf563214e3082b26a34993cc53ff7; 138bb942514e7e93a47b47c4f6cef8995ba3e19c; 6a204afbbe2728ebf20dc1809d284629ebfc3123; e6f457c734f66af84c2e0aeaeb2e2e26f1aa1570; 4c92fdb3b3ad9e41e7041208a78d9b8116f99018; e51290fae5654b3bbcd09f152c0fb94a01916b60; d5e97c69915d61015826b4792f32a1d1a1a9660f; 2bd7e5376297bf13bcf76fbc0aa526da73a89916; 2330d109fb2db67abea66533d122210188fa282f; a193276774ce188d7d75593f3d2a3a34839acced; 56378d1f074e8c80925fbddb5294271debedade6; 8f147c54fa5266ec9597028ce73d3a8c816e6b9d; e1c74a9898c567df9e0fc48a88ec4be99accdbf4; c597c224fe04693423c7d34c08dfb5604d8ea8e3; b7b4fbc2078ecbea318bf39dda76574c911bf8d4; ba2f68401132c130ce9dbad65e011b5c2a58936a; dece3606478f7ecd0981e60b7872ef51e05aaa37; d5e6da407caf9362249adb6ac1e188d4d0fc824b; 64de4fade0ad4a43521ee8c5e4073e19dd2f289d; ad1187d9b6733d1a58c23337dd28656b69019385; c932e8fc8fc235527b7546a0026d4d29e3b3cfc9; e2ec442c3360758fc4e1fee5bb78766d99a6ad04; eaa51df04353cd5da0880031fde523bdc3baa13f; b7fe7a305719937e96f8e0d3dcbb451d4b53ccf5; 2d8e3e42209723611e8fb54fdc78f49a4c3bca84; ae28dcdee2c798d3de373f21010aad63e5be8254; 6d4107d1fecdaadc4f4dd5f4cc030ab05b0cde30; 1ab3d167e4240b21eea5caa0590ea1aeeccbc0f7; 358e492b8d0ff139ac15f33fac7edebba21335ce; 770221d5bc214657b93e6dc677b03228645a4660; 915506c02e84b7b501b86238c728a1f03294ca21; 17ae49bf3f8000bfdac36f6a44e71baa77ae1e26; b947f7bb13a1692f785cbeeec529bbb426367c5c; d150e6d703abf10615ad1761db9b2f0d7bf1230e; 4e701f795490136946c479be637134bb6ad772ad; 948e4e69bc62f89dd1d485f7b2a64a720209b685,Aging (Albany NY),11,4478 - 4509
c5820ea7a4833520e246cf8de47de440620d2059,An Efficient Algorithm For Weak Hierarchical Lasso,"Linear regression is a widely used tool in data mining and machine learning. In many applications, fitting a regression model with only linear effects may not be sufficient for predictive or explanatory purposes. One strategy that has recently received increasing attention in statistics is to include feature interactions to capture the nonlinearity in the regression model. Such model has been applied successfully in many biomedical applications. One major challenge in the use of such model is that the data dimensionality is significantly higher than the original data, resulting in the small sample size large dimension problem. Recently, weak hierarchical Lasso, a sparse interaction regression model, is proposed that produces a sparse and hierarchical structured estimator by exploiting the Lasso penalty and a set of hierarchical constraints. However, the hierarchical constraints make it a non-convex problem and the existing method finds the solution to its convex relaxation, which needs additional conditions to guarantee the hierarchical structure. In this article, we propose to directly solve the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso by making use of the General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) optimization framework, which has been shown to be efficient for solving non-convex sparse formulations. The key step in GIST is to compute a sequence of proximal operators. One of our key technical contributions is to show that the proximal operator associated with the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso admits a closed-form solution. However, a naive approach for solving each subproblem of the proximal operator leads to a quadratic time complexity, which is not desirable for large-size problems. We have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Results show that our proposed algorithm is much more efficient and effective than its convex relaxation. To this end, we further develop an efficient algorithm for computing the subproblems with a linearithmic time complexity. In addition, we extend the technique to perform the optimization-based hierarchical testing of pairwise interactions for binary classification problems, which is essentially the proximal operator associated with weak hierarchical Lasso. Simulation studies show that the non-convex hierarchical testing framework outperforms the convex relaxation when a hierarchical structure exists between main effects and interactions.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yashu Liu"", ids = ""46398377""); list(name = ""Jie Jin Wang"", ids = ""39380925""); list(name = ""Jieping Ye"", ids = ""144030870"")",2e20b8443661f7175fcb4a31f3dca5e418e9dfe6; 50c302996efc805e57bb325013a843de42234a35; 1bc9c94bf695f3eb8ea653073fee8842817797bf; bff2951d6a5cc757650bfefa16440a08879da75b; 17976a3111c51f6d46faf19212c3a67e72aecc74; c7fa37eb9b776b965918fa69ba9a15893ccd207f; 147f1aae6d430f9f711bb39343025e1363add1f0; f0951665942dcb80e795cfbe68b65d0dbda59b17,2459b894c4c1179c5f27f432e4a9f0fbec34c5f4; 0cdc5c4c92692690eacd0ea244b467742c3719e3; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 98e34ae07310f8051fd7ea50ce10fbf7dcbd0bbd; d8feb336c1691aa82a7f655c4fb0f6751dbef277; d8540ccb794de41c11d921f0ee140b6ea6017b06; 927de77d0002851c150be9fb0ea2204880135f3f; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; 12708404cd61a0e8e2c1f8c7fc84031441898b56; 3edae395b2a2e8a5a1796367cb7d1b0b206079d0; c42d04eba814b98818f57e5cb1609f68be7126d4; abc465130f4036f9d677d41dc896fed33fd8b2ae; 0025fc4f00c21960297fbdf83220d6bde75da645; 1fa41efefe5e4d36b30b4f209b3ad94767fb814c; 10a344e876bccc5ff4b7dec698164afe5dd72a9c; 408eb55adaee1aee680a23210e7cfe5510e87677; 70777b42821995e2ec8c5f7cd9959e95cac9c29c; 92927eed3836a927d822fdb8248a45426366d76c; e03d6594270e3241b02be1dc30faa2234f98f707; de887b3547a6a774563100a28b9390d394b90132; 721b926c593d23523156fe77f67731cdf287d9d1; 37b573e791a5e41ef3b59e6f68f58a8cbe9f8cdf; 10d85561e4aafc516d10064f30dff05b41f70afe; da23dd461f0cb05bf11c316b3f0d56bd77a649dc; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; 1fa3f282ee879a55b649e4d50bac92f6e50551f8; 896e3cea1338af252be86cef916d1bf3cb48927f; c4a8564c65769cb55304e17a9f7fa64cf29d57ec; c9d6e6d2e16198bb3abeecf914028a8f5b6d5dca; 8965ac8b18694f6c35b2907686e7a2665ace5baf; e7f716ab4e23cfb423a4f6b19363678d922a76f3,ACM Trans.

We propose to estimate the unknown conditional mixture density by an l 1 -penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We shall provide an l 1 -oracle inequality satisfied by this Lasso estimator with the Kullbackâ€“Leibler loss. In particular, we give a condition on the regularization parameter of the Lasso to obtain such an oracle inequality. Our aim is twofold: to extend the l 1 -oracle inequality established by Massart and Meynet [12] in the homogeneous Gaussian linear regression case, and to present a complementary result to Stadler et al. [18], by studying the Lasso for its l 1 -regularization properties rather than considering it as a variable selection procedure. Our oracle inequality shall be deduced from a finite mixture Gaussian regression model selection theorem for l 1 -penalized maximum likelihood conditional density estimation, which is inspired from Vapnikâ€™s method of structural risk minimization [23] and from the theory on model selection for maximum likelihood estimators developed by Massart in [11].",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Caroline Meynet"", ids = ""2086033"")",537aef561443c68de003b1235779f8a174924b24; 1a6a351d77c8df47e9813b89d173ecdd51efc76e; 78d043890cea1d7be9883f4f8b9da40d773a5d15; 2f824d810299411deb82052183715bba2189e98c; 1f961a8907d17f5681602d6e95ea7b51c0da7bee; 77516dcb9343fab53922365f2eaf36dfc40c104f; 1d7149df3046beb363e28fa636826da8847fab22; f810027367c618f59ea713bf7f74b68182e92038; f315c474c07f529954c6a7876260638fdd7eb6cb,500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 5301035892388fd6b36c970e0abf9320232fa1a6; 78ecaabe915ba7df950671d36f92678192802df4; 385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e; 324b559eb974b3a7c2ed0d4a74f398aa07958184; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 54323bf565cea5d2aaee88a03ec9d1d3444a9bfd; 7aa39f7f3b69473705e247dd2b3a9689f10fbbc3; 9e7fe6e37a17c5f103633c06febf7ba521347511; b16f3ba80efbdf8a907de36c81a21d6c6aaa3ebc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; db31973871f5648cffb02e7590582376e16ad0bb; 09bf78f0151a2da7149ec4e7e5cadef1b3eee814; 19f90a8c59b2b5924debf81fc38c53f2f445b236; fe4b07489942fc80654e9a87663aee3aa5119429; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 87771377a99ee556de402bf7e9d7097b2fda42de; 94de78edbc3d17bcbc6336830abcd5badd01ddd1; 3d02c5ac0f5ed1e7d16eac651b10549c6619e71e; 9c41fe875e10e6ef08b610a5fbc2587783b6dab8; 2540b36616761e6fde519eed00aef8f0e5e412a0; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; b3d62cff3b1e4191307c2ad7b4dd3745aa4f88ed,Esaim: Probability and Statistics,17,650-671
645e0d2bc20fca9db2fee17ca1efcb3ad3616b66,"Mothers who sell sex: a potential paradigm for integrated HIV, sexual, and reproductive health interventions among women at high risk of HIV in Burkina Faso.","BACKGROUND
Antenatal care is a point of entry into the health system for women across Africa and may facilitate the uptake of HIV services among female sex workers (FSWs). This study aimed to evaluate the determinants of motherhood among FSWs, their sexual risks, and their engagement in health care.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to July 2013 among FSWs in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The study used respondent-driven sampling for HIV testing and behavioral data collection. Predictors of motherhood and the association of motherhood and sex work dynamics were assessed separately using logistic regression.


RESULTS
Of the 696 women enrolled, the majority of participants (76.6%, n = 533) had at least 1 biological child. Mothers were more likely to have a nonpaying partner [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20 to 2.49], and significantly less likely to currently desire to conceive (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.33). Motherhood was predictive of having reduced condomless vaginal or anal sex with a new client [age-adjusted odds ratio (aaOR), 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.97] in the past 30 days, and increased condomless vaginal or anal sex with a nonpaying partner (aaOR, 1.49; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.96). Motherhood was prognostic of a higher likelihood of ever being tested for HIV (aaOR, 1.89; 95% CI: 1.55 to 2.31). Motherhood was predictive of reporting limited difficulty when accessing health services (aaOR, 0.15; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.34).


CONCLUSIONS
Motherhood is common among FSWs. The results indicate that FSWs who are mothers may have more exposure to health care because of seeking antenatal/perinatal services, presenting important opportunities for inclusion in the HIV continuum of care and to prevent vertical transmission.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Erin Papworth"", ids = ""50521128""); list(name = ""Sheree R Schwartz"", ids = ""40325665""); list(name = ""Odette Ky-Zerbo"", ids = ""1400787221""); list(name = ""Benjamin Leistman"", ids = ""14660090""); list(name = ""Gautier H.

Two home-made (Amino-P-C18, Amino-P-C10) and one commercial (IAM.PC.DD2) HILIC stationary phases were considered. Logarithm of retention factor at 5% of acetonitrile (logkACN) along with descriptors obtained for 16 nucleosides and 11 pterins were used to develop QSRR models. We used and compared the predictive performance of three regression techniques: partial least square (PLS), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the LASSO followed by stepwise multiple linear regression. The highest predictive squared correlation coefficient (QLOOCV(2)) in PLS analysis was found for Amino-P-C10 (QLOOCV(2)=0.687) and IAM.PC.DD2 (QLOOCV(2)=0.506) and the lowest for IAM.PC.DD2 (QLOOCV(2)=-0.01). Much higher values were obtained for the LASSO model. The QLOOCV(2) equaled 0.9 for Amino-P-C10, 0.66 for IAM.PC.DD2 and 0.59 for Amino-P-C18. The combination of LASSO with stepwise regression provided models with comparable predictive performance as the LASSO, however with possibility of calculating the standard error of estimates. The use of LASSO itself and in combination with classical stepwise regression may offer greater stability of the developed models thanks to more smooth change of coefficients and reduced susceptibility towards chance correlation. Application of QSRR-based approach, along with the computational methods proposed in this work, may offer a useful approach in the modeling of retention of nucleoside and pterin compounds in HILIC.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emilia Daghir-Wojtkowiak"", ids = ""1398830099""); list(name = ""PaweÅ‚ Wiczling"", ids = ""5947000""); list(name = ""Szymon Bocian"", ids = ""6432058""); list(name = ""Å\201ukasz Kubik"", ids = ""13795799""); list(name = ""Piotr KoÅ›liÅ„ski"", ids = ""13087957""); list(name = ""BogusaÌµw Buszewski"", ids = ""152974306""); list(name = ""Roman Kaliszan"", ids = ""5031468""); list(name = ""MichaÅ‚ Jan Markuszewski"", ids = ""3708522"")",c347455635937147208e741368ec80b590d1204e; a4e3d73167c2010cf77d9c6d2c23a082141d7136; 1f292bf68e6624699d5f024c6910155eeb645d18; a49eb271ec037eab90e7e3bbb20ec4d4fb13f43b; 5dd7663cf9ded22b0de1369daee656c89a3b0862; a35ad278026488fb0502599e7d3af7a561214f75; 79b35487368edcb6fad0aa161d01d59307f985e7; 07d7a3ea3682ab3d0db8d3ddd37c82968e5e0cac; 343e1cd2d15db38264a23d0e6a4224af94eb5f85; ec418fc7c6bc223e767227f6735b1e324702f33c; 65f1e0682f821ea49b89421fdaaf6fc952843ff9,246e7e386b40b35534d77b9438cf836af0c567f8; c9ec090c9afc2dee7fa7948acdff4cbb5d2bc1b2; 84fa734a26a63dc4476ae76fbb04f4955c4b3287; 68244f554ce4646eb3a630870b088e2bb0dce553; a1120cd5b8532ecc766cc1536aaf7d0c49a6a7e3; ce984e49997709352d0a4f3cfe1d91cf5cd6af2c; 39c3bb42b18fc9e22d9a424efc544dbeff5815d3; eac101d91095dc71a5bdd536e767ca87b1c24e0e; 8b4d0140fb551fd66dd85a5eb6e335b2d9d3a7e4; 210de3d8432e61cdd07bf401c279bbf8cd5ffed7; 40356d13e056e396a885b2527d77b37a1050d777; 717ce0992d640e385ae389f353e82c198b96958b; 5ffb7d6393d947062dee15494db2da9c9e37ed17; 13821d501ff6e70b4500d5eb0f5022b1f48ad47e; 27ce818fe234e4bdea82ab17fb128e856e77e432; 73fb9d7a6f65713c227e0e33916c41bf2180f447; 469a1049c2a77388c36d783b9b38b8bd1279cbfb; c8e477f815352bcbe528eb295d89cb5e718b016b; 09d3b900718b9e1c031f35352552e6123863b1a6; 65acc7ba51daadf155dc1a4bfb4894a846c4d466; 263b416888201f821e6b123a8858068380dfe7b3; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; e06a494bdbefb0574381b51332d1586008558fc7; dfca79c02944645cdb207936e84cb2c93d25d126; dbaf059fd140d1c0219088d93a8b131c961541d0; 49b882aebf756d904aad12b9fd3f568b283551fe; 43a7369ac7580b7915ca5b701ab8241cf7d21c2b; 2655956b9202cac10c5837337a7d94d5afd73a54; 5ec5a4b8025d3b07f77b7614a0fa01676e72f5bd,Journal of chromatography.

7e37395ee90fed1d8923d7e6e9ef9b68723c5176,Adaptive Non-Parametric Regression With the $K$-NN Fused Lasso,"The fused lasso, also known as total-variation denoising, is a locally-adaptive function estimator over a regular grid of design points. In this paper, we extend the fused lasso to settings in which the points do not occur on a regular grid, leading to an approach for non-parametric regression. This approach, which we call the $K$-nearest neighbors ($K$-NN) fused lasso, involves (i) computing the $K$-NN graph of the design points; and (ii) performing the fused lasso over this $K$-NN graph. We show that this procedure has a number of theoretical advantages over competing approaches: specifically, it inherits local adaptivity from its connection to the fused lasso, and it inherits manifold adaptivity from its connection to the $K$-NN approach.

Information on rainfall is very important for farmers to anticipate extreme events that can cause losses in agriculture. Extreme rainfall patterns can be modeled by Bayesian quantile regression. Parameters of the model are estimated by MCMC. This study used statistical downscaling to obtain relationship between global scale data and local scale data. The data were monthly rainfall data in West Java based on three type of land, low, medium, high land, and GCM output data. LASSO regularization was used to overcome multicollinearity problem in GCM output data. The purpose of this study was to model Bayesian quantile regression in each type of land. The Bayesian quantile regression model in the lowlands can predict extreme rainfall accurately and consistently in one year ahead.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Eko Primadi Hendri"", ids = ""1395167948""); list(name = ""Aji Hamim Wigena"", ids = ""41033579""); list(name = ""Anik Djuraidah"", ids = ""18133721"")",,,International Journal of Sciences: Basic and Applied Research,47,142-151
f9abec3cfa0cd9c14c6cac17bde3b4bf49de971c,Identification of Prognostic and Metastatic Alternative Splicing Signatures in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Background: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the malignancy originated from the renal epithelium, with a high rate of distant metastasis. Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA are widely reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of multiple cancers. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of alternative splicing events (ASEs) underlying tumorigenesis and metastasis of KIRC. Methods: RNA-seq of 537 KIRC samples downloaded from the TCGA database and ASEs data from the TCGASpliceSeq database were used to identify ASEs in patients with KIRC. The univariate and Lasso regression analysis were used to screen the most significant overall survival-related ASEs (OS-SEs). Based on those, the OS-SEs model was proposed. The interaction network of OS-SEs and splicing factors (SFs) with absolute value of correlation coefficient value >0.750 was constructed by Pearson correlation analysis. The OS-SEs significantly related to distant metastasis and clinical stage were identified by non-parametric test, and those were also integrated into co-expression analysis with prognosis-related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways identified by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). ASEs with significance were selected for multiple online database validation. Results: A total of prognostic 6,081 overall survival-related ASEs (OS-SEs) were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis and a prediction model was constructed based on 5 OS-SEs screened by Lasso regression with the Area Under Curve of 0.788. Its risk score was also illustrated to be an independent predictor, which the good reliability of the model. Among 390 identified candidate SFs, DExD-Box Helicase 39B (DDX39B) was significantly correlated with OS and metastasis. After external database validation, Retained Intron of Ras Homolog Family Member T2 (RHOT2) and T-Cell Immune Regulator 1 (TCIRG1) were identified. In the co-expression analysis, overlapped co-expression signal pathways for RHOT2 and TCIRG1 were sphingolipid metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusions: Based on the results of comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, we proposed that aberrant DDX39B regulated RHOT2-32938-RI and TCIRG1-17288-RI might be associated with the tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis of KIRC via sphingolipid metabolism or N-glycan biosynthesis pathway.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tong Meng"", ids = ""36349233""); list(name = ""Runzhi Huang"", ids = ""144532423""); list(name = ""Zhiwei Zeng"", ids = ""150358880""); list(name = ""Zongqiang Huang"", ids = ""15766744""); list(name = ""Huabin Yin"", ids = ""2402289""); list(name = ""Chenchen Jiao"", ids = ""35605860""); list(name = ""Penghui Yan"", ids = ""92697275""); list(name = ""Peng Hu"", ids = ""143941721""); list(name = ""Xiaolong Zhu"", ids = ""49898014""); list(name = ""Zhao-rong Li"", ids = ""49969228""); list(name = ""Dian-wen Song"", ids = ""6141137""); list(name = ""Jie Zhang"", ids = ""50562116""); list(name = ""Liming Cheng"", ids = ""145156570"")",,08351de70d7d8226db4419a423d7fa9003ae833c; 551dcc9b62de0592d67e82e99b2346e0f85abe4c; 5422cf970fa5b7e3db14637cb40c7a1c807a6d28; 76717cece0a6fa9450b205690c7627421a71d4c3; d7f1b53cda1adb2eee3624fa0c60d6733d51c1cb; c5731cfb36e9cd08a6084254376feb57730090ba; b14b777ebd11597564b6c3e2c9e2f6fc8f4403a5; c73c63c0cd0bf6dfc6b24a9acd222bde5a1e2392; 74039beeef7a9e72c6a534d7b1ee68a5e4b30338; b3e8da3a5b6a5a757ceae545a6aeda7d9d7bfc9a; bd25a39510413c5cbe5b1e0b56be8a5d1c19c58a; 820a08d866a3a7561352a85871aba3238dd7de83; 3042324a3721915578d6fbcb5166dc9807be9ac0; 1f512a9b8f9370bab62d1683a123019cec26c9db; bc5fd5480d14af5cc3e2fa3a82d99402b9830f60; 834b27f3299fa7523d04eca069c4f8f75c778441; 9befde493f38121ec24653eeadcd022686583b97; e1b8bf52993995e34b43233e09a85681043cf3c5; 9c42f733c7d2c8ce044f774b8f19d3f000d8943a; 7d061317805c24e38da74012afdcc7e447c35db7; a9ab29a389cf2d458780362b088c5efbd02b5615; fa288d419f7ce226d4bd1bd38a15068d3d5e0cd1; 0eddd22bb87a68bd16b981550b7b769a9ba26cec; d4d34f1f9ec6410c93e997aaad3741f082ed7d4c; 0a959bc4c8039cbd251971d8eb3970ba3c947647; 9d700488baaf3fc9412ed822de5117f63b79af4c; 50c81688dec2d76288001654f7c33ae9655b725d; 84c4462f922d71e096243a1fc1db80a113b4009a; 25499b135ba21791ebd534f3d44076fa62416183; 7bdc7dad9f2eb49d43b1b454941e247ecf678c1b; 1c833a4bd7e0b7325f435ed92703d76822dd2b8f; af567331df59649a5b8a151b4f60e6ddd5ce67a8; 8ac5d66fdc1eb54dfd3d99aa68e97f0e1b1fec42; cf5361c142e72e17852f94697514d9f40d0d7b10; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 78759ba0a1120b0e1299b3028d1eafaf8263db9a; 58c51dd280c50d8ce09c135eea9eedf469f0c9b5; 999171017924bc7aa5d5cb21c685f12f0873307e; 0c8b4336b56540f40b970cf0b6f85275d36233e5; 2e3535f8f1a7999918362df483b7ec806c8b764f; 2615097c06a257afc7b488147995feea06e242f3; 23b6ccb034aea4695f11978a015fafee0dfe7fef; d734efc67f8f3581561fc21efebb85af2c1c682a; c90030a352917df95889824e60155ccbceff3633; 3f88c2c6b76daab3b32255b9a8cfbdc36a424c1e; 3e8850324f28f9216b8f42976d763c491421be88; f831578339782c4883c70c2dd4aa66b6565b218a; 2710025ccf366914b12839338695c937034e3ea0; 23fa53e6797ddac326dc2feef876221cef8a5b6d; 465243e55eca9d7adb5538d2419281726d0b1af8; ce815753d80d227d10d9d73587fb8be8fdb9ccfb; 3af045503abf81705fc1833aadf5db93a9be854c; f8eab912fe91cbdc5613eecdef7ef016b5163eb7; 2b4040440d9b3b3e4edff0eb5e3283c93f0b3baa; af8e1824443058ad383c9f2e883c0a3b992b21e8,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,7,

f9ab3091879e0ca568301583491b2685a13128e9,A flexible adaptive lasso Cox frailty model based on the full likelihood,"In this work a method to regularize Cox frailty models is proposed that accommodates time-varying covariates and time-varying coefficients and is based on the full instead of the partial likelihood. A particular advantage in this framework is that the baseline hazard can be explicitly modeled in a smooth, semi-parametric way, e.g. via P-splines. Regularization for variable selection is performed via a lasso penalty and via group lasso for categorical variables while a second penalty regularizes wiggliness of smooth estimates of time-varying coefficients and the baseline hazard. Additionally, adaptive weights are included to stabilize the estimation. The method is implemented in R as coxlasso and will be compared to other packages for regularized Cox regression. Existing packages, however, do not allow for the combination of different effects that are accommodated in coxlasso.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Maike Hohberg"", ids = ""51182459""); list(name = ""Andreas Groll"", ids = ""115638162"")",,90d2f838b63863cb0f8297106db864e7b87c8cfc; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; 8537f7d886fa75957d269336efb66ce0d4c1a58e; 57eb99efd44142f7617b1a07b53cea8ca8b4dfcb; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9; cb44fb606a3c3ea6146b8e5689edcc11ac0f7190; fd89a9d873265c46da2db3c41db150a3ec1c5c6e; 155c9157f1860183eadc7e9ef22f2d4db37d24de; 33daba8e35246ded6a7d54cea3f8396504bc0f8f; 943556f472b2bd745dfa535927c0e1a2957faacd; 4d1f0de6af478de3e0856abe187837f30c480a68; 16b91b3444d6e971877f57e68b306f1de8b023ae; 664378246cc5802f40276e79d9a9ce3b37303ea5; 33889980f6f8e05bf053eb0b5877ac35096aba2e; 204b0c6637a14ee1b1a1149bb0e974bdc3d825a8; 4a37299449defa2b68632d0fbbec27f4e04de9ed; 45a5bf4126c47c1bacac33d77ee91a7dc04ebdac; be0495ecc4017875f0ed83cc96e9e30145520dc7; 815f5280fa3c080533f1bfd7891268e61efb5bff; 73001f69d8c7bd6d97c851cf0a570473b772ccb3; b9f6e9ac6c1f07a1875b07791ab08a9d37936f14; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; fee39939a454c39125beea2a02021f790b448daa; 9871c9dce9887bf4798b5cd0a6aab34c3363b898; 6dce8ac6af4b473612f8ab6ff61c919c3976401b; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf,arXiv: Methodology,,

In this paper, we bridge this gap by cross-fertilizing these two paradigms with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure for variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression. We introduce a new class of self-adaptive penalty functions that arise from a fully Bayes spike-and-slab formulation, ultimately moving beyond the separable penalty framework. A virtue of these non-separable penalties is their ability to borrow strength across coordinates, adapt to ensemble sparsity information and exert multiplicity adjustment. The Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure harvests efficient coordinate-wise implementations with a path-following scheme for dynamic posterior exploration. We show on simulated data that the fully Bayes penalty mimics oracle performance, providing a viable alternative to cross-validation.

facba39c74f7c069df4c9c3a9acde16a60cb7f60,2017 International Cancer Education Conference Late-Breaking Abstracts,"Background/Purpose: While studies indicate significant differences regarding medical mistrust among Black and White breast cancer patients, little has been done to determine perceptions and determinants of mistrust amongst Black breast cancer patients. We examined sociodemographic factors that attribute to medical mistrust among Black women, while exploring the relationship betweenmedical mistrust, patient satisfaction, and provider communication. Learning Objectives: The participant shall be able to 1) Discuss issues of mistrust that exist within the Black cancer community; 2) Identify factors that contribute and are related to medical mistrust among Black breast cancer survivors. Methods: A convenience sample of 359 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and who identified as Black or White were eligible for and completed the parent study. Each participant completed one telephone survey consisting of questions pertaining to sociodemographics, and attitudes, feelings, and beliefs about medical care and breast cancer treatments. Categorical variables were calculated according to ChiSquare, while the F-test was employed for continuous variables. Multiple linear regression (Lasso Method) determined predictors of medical mistrust. Results/Findings: The sample for this investigation consisted of n=210 Black women (58.4%). The linear regression model indicated that women with greater medical mistrust reported less general satisfaction with their medical care (p=0.004). Also, those who obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher had less medical mistrust (p=0.05). Additionally, women with public insurance demonstrated greater mistrust (p=0.01). While not a contributor to the model, employment status was associated with medical mistrust (p =0.01). Analysis did not indicate a relationship between communication and group-based medical mistrust. Discussion: Findings from this study may inform future endeavors to educate providers on ways to effectively interact with and treat Black breast cancer patients. Findings may also aid in the development of interventions that address and tackle issues of mistrust as reported by Black patients. Further examination is warranted to determine the role, significance, and relationship between socioeconomic factors and group-based medical mistrust. References: Molina, Y. (2015).

8f0c13ce0edfd005a98bc2693af157aa23affaf0,Two-step approach for assessing the health effects of environmental chemical mixtures: application to simulated datasets and real data from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study,"BackgroundThere is increasing interest in examining the consequences of simultaneous exposures to chemical mixtures. However, a consensus or recommendations on how to appropriately select the statistical approach analyzing the health effects of mixture exposures which best aligns with study goals has not been well established. We recognize the limitations that existing methods have in effectively reducing data dimension and detecting interaction effects when analyzing chemical mixture exposures collected in high dimensional datasets with varying degrees of variable intercorrelations. In this research, we aim to examine the performance of a two-step statistical approach in addressing the analytical challenges of chemical mixture exposures using two simulated data sets, and an existing data set from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study as a representative case study.MethodsWe propose to use a two-step approach: a robust variable selection step using the random forest approach followed by adaptive lasso methods that incorporate both dimensionality reduction and quantification of the degree of association between the chemical exposures and the outcome of interest, including interaction terms. We compared the proposed method with other approaches including (1) single step adaptive lasso; and (2) two-step Classification and regression trees (CART) followed by adaptive lasso method.ResultsUtilizing simulated data sets and applying the method to a real-life dataset from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study, we have demonstrated good performance of the proposed two-step approach. Results from the simulation datasets indicated the effectiveness of variable dimension reduction and reliable identification of a parsimonious model compared to other methods: single-step adaptive lasso or two-step CART followed by adaptive lasso method.ConclusionsOur proposed two-step approach provides a robust way of analyzing the effects of high-throughput chemical mixture exposures on health outcomes by combining the strengths of variable selection and adaptive shrinkage strategies.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Li Luo"", ids = ""145466768""); list(name = ""Laurie G.

f8f3921889504125da096177787c9438b513fdbc,Abstract 683: A machine learning based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for anti-PD-1 therapy using non-invasive blood marker and clinical information for lung cancer patients,"Cancer immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 therapy (Î±PD-1) has greatly improved the survival outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rates of Î±PD-1 are around 20-30% based on clinical trials. The presence of PD-L1, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte or tumor mutation burden may be used as indicators of response, but are still limited to predict Î±PD-1 response. In this study, we established the machine learning based clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict the Î±PD-1 response by comprehensively combining clinical information and blood-based data which are easily assessable in routine practice.We enrolled 126 patients with NSCLC treated with the Î±PD-1 at Yonsei cancer center. Clinical data including patient characteristics, mutation, treatment outcomes, and adverse events were collected and analyzed. Forty patients additionally had blood-based immune data by flow cytometry. There were two data sets; clinical data set (n=126) with 15 variables, and immune data set (n=40) with 37 variables. We found that 27 variables out of 52 variables are selected by recursive feature elimination. The responders are defined as PR or SD â‰¥6 months and the non-responders are defined as the others. Supervised learning algorithms such as the LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, SVM, ANN, and RF were applied to each data set for predicting the Î±PD-1 response. The performances of each model were evaluated according to the ROC curve or cross-validation errors. Variable importance was measured by using the random forest and gradient boosting.Patient characteristics included male (69.8%), age â‰¥ 60 years (66.2%), ECOG 0/1 (77.7%), adenocarcinoma (69.8%), EGFR mutations (15.1%), and PD-L1 positive (61.2%). We classified the patients into responders (38%) and non-responders (62%) in total 126 patients. A result from the clinical data set of 126 patients demonstrated that the Ridge regression model (AUC: 0.78) can more accurately predict the Î±PD-1 response than others. Of 15 clinical variables, some are considered to be important in the following order; tumor burden,age, PD-L1, ECOG PS, and irAE based on the random forest. When we performed the machine learning process with clinical and immune data, The Ridge regression model (AUC:0.82) showed the good performance to predict Î±PD-1 response, compared to the single clinical model. The machine learning based CDSS for aPD-1 to NSCLC patients has benefit for predicting aPD-1 responses. Our prediction model could be easily accessible and fast processed in routine practice. The supervised machine learning based non-invasive predictive score (NIPS) demonstrates the rate of aPD-1 response on NSCLC patients. We will validate NIPS in independent patient cohort and currently are establishing the NIPS as web-based software.

c0c8e6291b2975b9c260e82c55ca903bf52216f7,ROS Regression: Integrating Regularization and Optimal Scaling Regression,"In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided.

7e851e1092eb3a4f7476e3ad2510b265392bf7d3,FIRST: Combining forward iterative selection and shrinkage in high dimensional sparse linear regression,"We propose a new class of variable selection techniques for regression in high dimensional linear models based on a forward selection version of the LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net, respectively to be called as forward iterative regression and shrinkage technique (FIRST), adaptive FIRST and elastic FIRST. These methods seem to work effectively for extremely sparse high dimensional linear models. We exploit the fact that the LASSO, adaptive LASSO and elastic net have closed form solutions when the predictor is onedimensional. The explicit formula is then repeatedly used in an iterative fashion to build the model until convergence occurs. By carefully considering the relationship between estimators at successive stages, we develop fast algorithms to compute our estimators. The performance of our new estimators are compared with commonly used estimators in terms of predictive accuracy and errors in variable selection.

Lâ€™abaque semble pouvoir sâ€™appliquer quel que soit le profil du patient (en modele de regression penalisee de type Â«Â lassoÂ Â» sur le VSRf comme sur le Delta [VSRf-VSR predit par le modele]Â : contribution principale negative de la PPT, pas de contribution du sexe, du diabete, du moment de seance, contribution moindre positive du BNP, du poids et de lâ€™Ã¢ge). Lâ€™utilisation du module BVM en systematique a donc ete deployee dans le centre. Discussion Actuellement, partir de lâ€™analyse sur 3Â mois de 250Â patients et 6214Â seances, le BVM est utilise dans 83Â % des seances (7Â % dâ€™UFminimale, 10Â % de refus) avec 60Â % des patients rentrant dans le modele (courbe VSR ideale et PPT egale a la valeur souhaiteeÂ Â±Â 300Â g). Conclusion Le deploiement du BVM est possible pour la majorite des patients a partir dâ€™un abaque fixant pour une UF donnee le VSR cible obtenu a partir des etudes de population et lâ€™UF-max.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""J.

c050c63af91c62a5b7bb885c8a0d2c9ad3bfafac,Soil moisture forecasting for irrigation recommendation,"Abstract This study integrates measured soil moisture sensor data, a remotely sensed crop vegetation index, and weather data to train models, in order to predict future soil moisture. The study was carried out on a cotton farm, with wireless soil moisture monitoring equipment deployed across five plots. Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine modeling methods were trialled. Random Forest models gave consistently good results (mean 7-day prediction error from 8.0 to 16.9 kPA except in one plot with malfunctioning sensors). Linear regression with two of the most important predictor variables was not as accurate, but allowed extraction of an interpretable model. The system was implemented in Google Cloud Platform and a model was trained continuously through the season. An online irrigation dashboard was created showing previous and forecast soil moisture conditions, along with weather and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This was used to guide operators in advance of irrigation water needs. The methodology developed in this study could be used as part of a closed-loop sensing and irrigation automation system.",2019,Environmental Science,"list(name = ""James Brinkhoff"", ids = ""2494877""); list(name = ""John Hornbuckle"", ids = ""1836121""); list(name = ""Carlos Ballester Lurbe"", ids = ""35973968"")",,,IFAC-PapersOnLine,52,385-390

We construct a variable set which includes the sponsors factors and netizens factors. Based on the TF-IDF method, we determine the exact type of projects in each category. Based on univariate test and lasso regression model, our empirical study suggests that both netizens and sponsors can influence the funding ratio of the five categories of CF projects respectively. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that a positive netizenâ€™s reaction toward the CF project shown on the platform increases the funding ratio of it. Besides, there are several types and regions of each category that receives higher funding ratio than others. These findings help the sponsors to make proper decisions, and to increase the funding ratio of each CF project.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yifei Guo"", ids = ""49813685""); list(name = ""Meihong Zhu"", ids = ""8185354""); list(name = ""Aihua Li"", ids = ""49779481"")",,,,,458-466

Computational methods are still needed to fulfil the task of pharmacosurveillance. In post-market surveillance, the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has been widely used to detect suspicious associations between medicines and ADEs. However, the passive mechanism of SRS leads to the hysteresis in ADE detection by SRS based methods, not mentioning the acknowledged problem of under-reporting and duplicate reporting in SRS. Therefore, there is a growing demand for other complementary methods utilising different types of healthcare data to assist with global pharmacosurveillance. Among those data sources, prescription data is of proved usefulness for pharmacosurveillance. However, few works have used prescription data for signalling ADEs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to discover medicines that are responsible for a given ADE purely from prescription data. Our method uses a logistic regression model to evaluate the associations between up to hundreds of suspected medicines and an ADE spontaneously and selects the medicines possessing the most significant associations via Lasso regularisation. To prepare data for training the logistic regression model, we adapt the design of the case-crossover study to construct case time and control time windows for the extraction of medicine use information. While the case time window can be readily determined, we propose several criteria to select the suitable control time windows providing the maximum power of comparisons. In order to address confounding situations, we have considered diverse factors in medicine utilisation in terms of the temporal effect of medicine and the frequency of prescription, as well as the individual effect of patients on the occurrence of an ADE. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted a case study with a real-world prescription dataset. Validated by the existing domain knowledge, our method successfully traced a wide range of medicines that are potentially responsible for the ADE. Further experiments were also carried out according to a recognised gold standard, our method achieved a sensitivity of 65.9% and specificity of 96.2%.",2020,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chen Zhan"", ids = ""6469958""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Ellen Roughead"", ids = ""3450402""); list(name = ""Limin Liu"", ids = ""92001241""); list(name = ""Nicole L Pratt"", ids = ""144910774""); list(name = ""Jiuyong Li"", ids = ""1786185"")",,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,104,101839
