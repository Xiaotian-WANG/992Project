efaa71b6348e16a03cdad205ecd8819ead308929,Causal Regularization,"I argue that regularizing terms in standard regression methods not only help against overfitting finite data, but sometimes also yield better causal models in the infinite sample regime. I first consider a multi-dimensional variable linearly influencing a target variable with some multi-dimensional unobserved common cause, where the confounding effect can be decreased by keeping the penalizing term in Ridge and Lasso regression even in the population limit. Choosing the size of the penalizing term, is however challenging, because cross validation is pointless. Here it is done by first estimating the strength of confounding via a method proposed earlier, which yielded some reasonable results for simulated and real data. Further, I prove a `causal generalization bound' which states (subject to a particular model of confounding) that the error made by interpreting any non-linear regression as causal model can be bounded from above whenever functions are taken from a not too rich class. In other words, the bound guarantees ""generalization"" from observational to interventional distributions, which is usually not subject of statistical learning theory (and is only possible due to the underlying symmetries of the confounder model).",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Dominik Janzing"", ids = ""1700657"")",5fc5f45932104eb1f905aa316067e485938c1b01,e9a7a043d2202f084be2b0e20a174b76940049e9; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; dcda0eb44128316042880d3061a92a1cb1302554; 642607e3b5880cbeee8f095d2c4bfb31c05510b5; 298d75a794452e0a9fbb99ab18f78ab6bd686f1f; 77c508a523efe545f786ea3efb3a169d198edd59; 011c1158be488122c87365567e357a631663323d; b393cd0b97c8ab7fe9b8679788216540e9d107ad; 9ed00111447ddb204c8db9fc01ba7122085470c7; ee46ec7b08e2069f99416a16ba9af0241d169180; afdc57412a7dadf2a392a16276f05df757d5b98b; ca0c590c9b3f1e95d92f776ff56a22177da6c1ac; f8d8e52ec60a7da7609c79cb3a19635385e180aa; 80db408970c1b8d4ebb664ac313bf5c452f95671; f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f; a2bf2e83df0c8b3257a8a809cb96c3ea58ec04b3; 385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e; 6727e07af9aca41b4813cddd61474cac3d3bb846; e863a3f17112429b5bc7b58d1e467fe08dc0ae69; d5051890e501117097eeffbd8ded87694f0d8063,ArXiv,abs/1906.12179,
09c12b0114c8bb8b39690cafea65f211545497b0,Regression Performance of Group Lasso for Arbitrary Design Matrices,"In many linear regression problems, explanatory variables are activated in groups or clusters; group lasso has been proposed for regression in such cases. This paper studies the nonasymptotic regression performance of group lasso using `1/`2 regularization for arbitrary (random or deterministic) design matrices. In particular, the paper establishes under a statistical prior on the set of nonzero coefficients that the `1/`2 group lasso has a near-optimal regression error for all but a vanishingly small set of models. The analysis in the paper relies on three easily computable metrics of the design matrix â€“ coherence, block coherence, and spectral norm. Remarkably, under certain conditions on these metrics, the `1/`2 group lasso can perform near-ideal regression even if the model order scales almost linearly with the number of rows of the design matrix. This is in stark contrast with prior work on the regression performance of the `1/`2 group lasso that only provides linear scaling of the model order for the case of random design matrices.

4bae5607aefaa50fa3ac9f91cdcb28f127f1ed21,Transient stability assessment in large-scale power systems based on the sparse single index model,"Abstract We apply a class of nonlinear semiparametric models to the problem of transient stability analysis of a large-scale power system. The mapping between the pre-contingency state and the transient stability boundary (TSB) is modelled by a block-oriented structure known as the single-index model (SIM). In this model one has a single dimensional projection that enters the unknown nonlinearity nonparametrically. Such models form a rich class of nonlinear mappings that includes classical models, e.g., linear and logistic regression, as special cases. The generalized case of the SIM is utilized that is taking into account the sparsity of the projection vector. This yields a low-dimensional nonlinear model suitable for high-dimensional data emerging in modern power systems. The parametric part of the model is obtained by the properly modified sparsity sensitive LASSO algorithm. The nonlinear nonparametric part of the model is estimated by the monotonically corrected kernel regression estimate. The precision of our modeling is verified for two fault cases of the 470-bus power system. It is shown that for the examined faults, the proposed modeling methodology exhibits a stronger prediction accuracy compared to the existing competing methods recently applied in the field, namely, kernel ridge regression, as well as LASSO linear modeling.",2020,Engineering,"list(name = ""Jiaqing Lv"", ids = ""1749869"")",,,Electric Power Systems Research,184,106291

This paper develops a deep residual neural network (ResNet) for the regression of nonlinear functions. Convolutional layers and pooling layers are replaced by fully connected layers in the residual block. To evaluate the new regression model, we train and test neural networks with different depths and widths on simulated data, and we find the optimal parameters. We perform multiple numerical tests of the optimal regression model on multiple simulated data, and the results show that the new regression model behaves well on simulated data. Comparisons are also made between the optimal residual regression and other linear as well as nonlinear approximation techniques, such as lasso regression, decision tree, and support vector machine. The optimal residual regression model has better approximation capacity compared to the other models. Finally, the residual regression is applied into the prediction of a relative humidity series in the real world. Our study indicates that the residual regression model is stable and applicable in practice.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dongwei Chen"", ids = ""47514457""); list(name = ""Fei Hu"", ids = ""1563020264""); list(name = ""Guokui Nian"", ids = ""146826334""); list(name = ""Tiantian Yang"", ids = ""1390163093"")",,,Entropy,22,193

In linear regression analysis, there are several assumptions that must be met that is normal distribution of errors, there is no correlation between the error and error variance is constant and homogent. There are some constraints that caused the assumption can not be met, for example, the correlation between independent variables (multicollinearity), constraints on the number of data and independent variables are obtained. When the number of samples obtained less than the number of independent variables, then the data is called the microarray data. Least Absolute shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a statistical method that can be used to overcome the microarray, overfitting, and multicollinearity. From the above description, it is necessary to study with the intention of comparing LASSO and PLS method. This study uses coronary heart and stroke patients data which is a microarray data and contain multicollinearity. With these two characteristics of the data that most have a weak correlation between independent variables, LASSO method produces a better model than PLS seen from the large RMSEP.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kadek Dwi Farmani"", ids = ""102333962""); list(name = ""I Putu Eka Nila Kencana"", ids = ""69921442""); list(name = ""Komang Gde Sukarsa"", ids = ""102594417"")",,,E-Jurnal Matematika,1,
ea014b1fc2537800c06c919631116fd9f4e330e6,Conjugate Direction Boosting,"Boosting in the context of linear regression has become more attractive with the invention of least angle regression (LARS), where the connection between the lasso and forward stagewise fitting (boosting) has been established. Earlier it has been found that boosting is a functional gradient optimization. Instead of the gradient, we propose a conjugate direction method (CDBoost). As a result, we obtain a fast forward stepwise variable selection algorithm. The conjugate direction of CDBoost is analogous to the constrained gradient in boosting. Using this analogy, we generalize CDBoost to: (1) include small step sizes (shrinkage) which often improves prediction accuracy; and (2) the nonparametric setting with fitting methods such as trees or splines, where least angle regression and the lasso seem to be unfeasible. The step size in CDBoost has a tendency to govern the degree between L0- and L1-penalization. This makes CDBoost surprisingly flexible.

Basically, a statistical model that identifies environmental variables linked to a species presence is searched for. In this sense, there is a wide array of analytical methods that identify important explanatory variables within a model, with higher explanatory and predictive power than classical regression approaches. However, some of these powerful models are not widespread in ornithological studies, partly because of their complex theory, and in some cases, difficulties on their implementation and interpretation. Here, I describe generalized linear models and other five statistical models for the analysis of bird habitat use and selection outperforming classical approaches: generalized additive models, mixed effects models, occupancy models, binomial N-mixture models and decision trees (classification and regression trees, bagging, random forests and boosting). Each of these models has its benefits and drawbacks, but major advantages include dealing with non-normal distributions (presence-absence and abundance data typically found in habitat use and selection studies), heterogeneous variances, non-linear and complex relationships among variables, lack of statistical independence and imperfect detection. To aid ornithologists in making use of the methods described, a readable description of each method is provided, as well as a flowchart along with some recommendations to help them decide the most appropriate analysis. The use of these models in ornithological studies is encouraged, given their huge potential as statistical tools in bird ecology. KeY-WOrDS: binomial mixture models, classification trees, generalized additive models, generalized linear models, mixed models, occupancy models, regression trees. â€œHabitat selectionâ€, by contrast, refers to a hierarchical process of behavioral responses that may result in the disproportionate use of habitats to influence survival and fitness of individuals (McGarigal et al. 2016). Therefore, habitat selection refers to a process, whereas habitat use refers to the pattern resulting from habitat selection (Jones 2001). In the field, standard approaches to assess bird habitat use or selection involve: (1) sampling the presence or abundance of individuals of a species across sampling units (typically transects or point counts; Bibby et al. 2000) across different habitat types, (2) comparing presence locations with random locations where the species could potentially be present across different habitat types (useavailability or case-control approach; Jones 2001, Keating & Cherry 2004, Johnson et al. 2006), or (3) using tracking devices on individual birds to acquire location data and compare them to available locations where the species was not recorded (Burger & Shaffer 2008, Wakefield et al. 2009, Bridge et al. 2011). With the rise of powerful statistical methods and the advancement of computing facility, more complex designs have been developed Model selection in bird ecology Palacio 91 Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia 26(2): 2018 Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia 26(2): 2018 to assess habitat use and selection. For instance, these approaches can be extended to make repeated visits at the same sampling sites (temporal dependence), repeated observations on the same individuals (e.g. individuals tracked) or sampling many sites located nearby (spatial dependence). Notwithstanding, a plethora of statistical models outperforming classical linear models and which have been used for a while in other research areas (e.g. generalized linear and additive mixed models, Hastie & Tibshirani 1990, Bolker et al. 2009, Zuur et al. 2009; classification and regression trees, De'ath 2002, 2007; Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Hirzel et al. 2002, Basille et al. 2008; quantile regression, Cade & Noon 2003; regularization methods such as ridge regression and LASSO, Reineking & SchrÃ¶der 2006, James et al. 2013; Artificial Neural Networks, Lek & GuÃ©gan 1999; Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Hastie et al. 1994; Support Vector Machines, Kecman 2005; Bayesian approaches, Ellison 2004) are still not widespread among ornithologists. Some of these methods (e.g. generalized additive models, mixed models), nevertheless, have been widely used in some particular bird groups, such as seabirds (Wakefield et al. 2009, Engler et al. 2017). This phenomenon may be partly due to their relatively complex theory, and in some cases, difficulties on their implementation and interpretation (Bolker et al. 2009, Zuur et al. 2009, Dahlgren 2010). This is accentuated for Bayesian modeling, which represents a completely different statistical paradigm (Dennis 1996, Dorazio 2016). Moreover, early-career researchers tend to be reluctant to new analytical methods, as a result of self-perceived lack of quantitative training (Barraquand et al. 2014). Despite these issues, the methods mentioned typically both offer greater insight than classical approaches and represent no longer a problem in terms of statistical assumptions (Elith et al. 2006, Bolker et al. 2009, Elith & Graham 2009, Shabani et al. 2016). From a statistical view, habitat use models aim to identify environmental variables linked to a species presence or abundance, and are species distribution models by definition (Guisan & Zimmerman 2000). On the other hand, habitat selection models link environmental variables with some proxy of fitness (nest site location, territories, reproductive output; Jones 2001). Although both types of models represent a correlative relationship between a bird species and its habitat, they are often expressed as a causal relationship, where the environment influences or explains the presence or abundance of a certain species:",2018,,"list(name = ""Facundo Xavier Palacio"", ids = ""35364132"")",,a4444df87554e25c20c41a60608252fc2a0c4d0d;

1ce7b042e67d909ccf6088c30bbf095dfe53597d,Face Recognition Using Sparse Representations and Manifold Learning,"Manifold learning is a novel approach in non-linear dimensionality reduction that has shown great potential in numerous applications and has gained ground compared to linear techniques. In addition, sparse representations have been recently applied on computer vision problems with success, demonstrating promising results with respect to robustness in challenging scenarios. A key concept shared by both approaches is the notion of sparsity. In this paper we investigate how the framework of sparse representations can be applied in various stages of manifold learning. We explore the use of sparse representations in two major components of manifold learning: construction of the weight matrix and classification of test data. In addition, we investigate the benefits that are offered by introducing a weighting scheme on the sparse representations framework via the weighted LASSO algorithm. The underlying manifold learning approach is based on the recently proposed spectral regression framework that offers significant benefits compared to previously proposed manifold learning techniques. We present experimental results on these techniques in three challenging face recognition datasets.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Grigorios Tsagkatakis"", ids = ""47952527""); list(name = ""Andreas E.

2553f50c6d25cb290b5a81ba5cee2a6df19a9d12,Groundwater Crustaceans as Useful Geological Tools,"Many stygobiont crustaceans presently living in continental subterranean waters are derived from ancestral coastal marine species which stay in sediments when shorelines receded far away during the geological periods of marine regression. The dispersal ability of stygobionts in continental groundwaters is especially low. Thus the present distribution of thalassoid stygobionts fits well with that of areas formerly covered by the sea; such stygobionts may provide information about the place of paleoshores, even when marine sediments were removed by erosion. The place of paleoshores of South-West Morocco are partly known from the survey and the analysis of the present regional stygofauna. The species groups resulting from the phylogenetic analysis of genera or families of thalassoid stygobionts and the analysis of their distribution, allow to date the colonization of groundwater by their marine ancestors. Thus the emersion of a Canarian island was dated by this way, as is datable the emergence of lands in Israel and Palestine. Introduction and General Background Some extant aquatic subterranean species may be used by geologists to locate the shoreline of a former transgressive sea or to date the definitive emersion of a continental sedimentary basin or of an oceanic island (STOCK, 1986; COINEAU, 1990; BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). Among metazoans, the crustacean group is the most diversified within groundwaters, both in plain and valley aquifers and in cave rivers or lakes. Such stygobiontic crustaceans (i.e. aquatic and subterranean) are troglobites, in karstic open water, or tiny interstitial phreatobites, in saturated porous sediments. Thalassostygobionts live in littoral marine cave or sediments and limnostygobionts occur in cave and aquifer freshwaters. Only the latter are considered hereafter. Some limnostygobionts belong to groups living also in surface freshwaters. They are derived from freshwater surface ancestors and are termed limnicoid. A well known example is that of the species of the amphipod Gammarus (CULVER et al., 1995).This kind of limnicoid stygobionts provides very few information about the period or the geological events related to the colonization of groundwaters by their ancestors, as this colonization may have occurred repeatedly at the same place and at different periods of the past, up to now. Therefore they are generally considered as uninformative for geologists. Other limnostygobionts belong to marine groups not known in freshwaters. Due to their direct marine origin they are called thalassoÃ¯d limnostygobionts (COINEAU & BOUTIN, 1992; BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). The marine origin of such crustaceans has been proposed for a long time (JEANNEL, 1943; DELAMARE DEBOUTTEVILLE, 1957, 1960; VANDEL, 1964, GINET & DECOU, 1977 etc...). For example, out of 350 cirolanid species (isopods), some 85% are epigean, marine or littoral, whereas the other 15% are freshwater stygobites more or less resembling their marine littoral ancestors (BOTOSANEANU, 1986). These stygobionts evolved from marine ancestral populations which first colonized littoral sediments (or sometimes littoral caves) in the Mesozoic or Cenozoic periods; thereafter they adapted to brackish water, then to freshwater and settled during a marine regression when the shoreline receded. This ""Regression model evolution"" (STOCK, 1977, 1980) was analysed and viewed as the second stage of a ""Two step model of colonization and evolution"" (BOUTIN & COINEAU, 1990; NOTENBOOM, 1991; COINEAU & BOUTIN, 1992; HOLSINGER, 1994). Thalassoid limnostygobionts consequently occur in sedimentary basins of continents formerly covered by the sea during a transgression, before the shoreline recede during the following regression. It is well known and 13th International Congress of Speleology 4th Speleological Congress of Latin AmÃ©rica and Caribbean 26th Brazilian Congress of Speleology BrasÃ­lia DF, 15-22 de julho de 2001 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------356 -------------------------------------------------------------------------www.sbe.com.br sbe@sbe.com.br generally accepted that interstitial crustaceans have very poor dispersal abilities (see for example HOLSINGER, 1986) and that stygobiontic populations stay in place and remain alive up today as ""Living fossils"" (DELAMARE DEBOUTTEVILLE & BOTOSANEANU, 1970; TERMIER, 1983), so that the most internal part of the present distribution area of a thalassoid stygobiont provides a good information about the place of the paleoshore during the maximum of the transgression (which occurred before the marine regression which will allow the colonization of groundwaters). Finally these living fossils are present markers of paleoshores. Geologists used to consider the limits of occurrence of sedimentary rocks deposited during a period of embayment as the location of the paleo-shorelines at the same period, except when there is a clear evidence of erosion of the considered layer. However in some cases these sedimentary rocks may have been completely removed by an important continental erosion. Consequently the groundwater primitively contained in these marine sedimentary formations have moved down and lasted in more ancient sediments or in the basal altered plutonic rocks, thus allowing the survival and permanence of thalassoid stygobiontic populations which remain the sole evidence of the marine transgression. Therefore the location of paleoshorelines may be inferred only from the limits of the present distribution area of these stygobionts. On the other hand the colonization of continental groundwaters by some thalassostygobiontic populations may have occured during the marine regression which resulted in the definitive emersion of a sedimentary basin (or an oceanic island when thalassoid limnostygobionts occur in groundwaters of an island). If it is possible to date this colonization i.e. the ecological change of crustacean biotopes, from coastal marine environment to continental groundwaters then it is possible to date the simultaneous marine regression. Now it is well known by paleontologists as well as by stygobiologists (DUCASSE et al., 1983; BOUTIN & COINEAU, 1991, 2000) that the evolutionary rate is faster in a changing and unstable environment, such as coastal biotopes, than in a more stable biotope like bathyal or phreatic and continental biotopes. Continental groundwater appears as a conservative environment housing a lot of ""living fossils"". Recent colonizers of groundwater which evolved for a longer time in littoral milieus than older colonizers exhibit therefore a more important morphological evolution than the more ancient colonizers, which evolved in littoral biotopes for a shorter period. It is why the phylogenetic analysis of the stygobitic species forming a genus or a family, generally shows that the most primitive lineages (monophyletic groups of species) include the species with a distribution indicating a freshwater entrance during the oldest geologic periods. In contrast, the most derived lineage comprises species, the origin of which is correlated with the latest marine regression in the study area. Therefore when the divergences of a cladogram are dated, based on biogeographic and geological data from a well known region, then it is possible to infer the date of a marine regression in another region if a new stygobiontic species of the group occurs in this new region. Moroccan stygobiontic models used in the Mediterranean Basin The geological history of Morocco is relatively well known, and two groups of stygobiontic crustaceans occur in numerous regions of this country. They are both sufficiently diversified in many species presently well known; their phylogenetic and biogeographic study provides the possibility of dating the origin of different lineages within each group. The family Metacrangonyctidae include to date more than 40 stygobiontic species of amphipods, about 36 of which occur in Morocco (MESSOULI, 1994). The cladistic analysis of the family clearly shows four lineages; three of them belong to the genus Metacrangonyx and the fourth and most derived one forms the genus Longipodacrangonyx (MESSOULI, 1988, 1994; BOUTIN, 1994b). The two more primitive lineages, morphologically well characterized, arise from a trifurcation dated from the Turonian regression (some 90 My BP), the third lineage appears later and in relation with the Senonian marine regression (70 My BP), and the last one, originating the genus Longipodacrangonyx, is related with the Lutetian regression (some 40 Ma) as the species of this genus occur only within the limits of eocene gulfs. The cirolanid isopods of the ""Typhlocirolana group"" include to date four genera and more than 25 stygobiontic species of which about 12 belong to two genera occurring in Morocco (BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). The cladogram of Moroccan species exhibit exactly the same topology as that of the metacrangonyctid amphipods, showing four clearly distinguishable lineages. The two more primitive lineages (having retained a number of characteristics of extant marine cirolanids) occur in regions flooded during the CenomanoTuronian times, the third lineage includes the most derived species of the genus Typhlocirolana which occurs in regions flooded during the Senonian, and the fourth lineage is formed by the genus Marocolana, whose distribution is included within the paleoshores of the Lutetian gulfs. 13th International Congress of Speleology 4th Speleological Congress of Latin AmÃ©rica and Caribbean 26th Brazilian Congress of Speleology BrasÃ­lia DF, 15-22 de julho de 2001 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------357 -------------------------------------------------------------------------www.sbe.com.br sbe@sbe.com.br The striking similarity of the two plylogenetic cladograms and that of the two area cladograms was pointed out by BOUTIN (1993a) and suggests the same historical biog",2010,,"list(name = ""Claude Boutin"", ids = ""51017944""); list(name = ""Nicole Coineau"", ids = ""49901136""); list(name = ""Mohammed Messouli"", ids = ""6528198""); list(name = ""Mohammed Yacoubi-Khebiza"", ids = ""120843746"")",,e356380972d56b0bd64834e89eea7f02837e91cb; 62e0f76cfa85aab6e53cf88152fa0c1fa48ea0d9; 3f56f10adba8be5b249feb3e7d6bddddd1014d63; 7c504355beea4169dafb6abd2c6725e2ac5d5212; 31b58b8e309844a63c45f81ff49f3ab930ed0ce5; 676ce534b66c7bd71accc7c97902cd3c3e04b5aa; 0b61f6012735d7e47a0700d3fbe0ee55db2b30b9; c0b7da15580e2765cdb7615a138b0771491a751d; d9f7a977e656b1e59c77cc48137fb0171ad4d9eb; 866b245476e586afd30018e083c23ce983697e07; d5daf86327d9dad2370d118d42498b6e52ae49c0; 48ee2d0dc68707ad110c4e8486aab509f542fb5b; f76ead44511bcff69d37146f7b82cf2f8b4d303d; ee763a11a4af60b278c3a02068c1faa0d9d752ef,,,

27dc8bc87ad5d763d597b257fb981f015fdde370,Version 1: \(\ell _1\)-Input Regularised Quadratic MPC,"This chapter introduces the first and simpler of the proposed \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC versions. The cost function is the same as for a standard quadratic MPC, with the addition of a 1-norm penalty on the input channels. Similar to LASSO regression and the elastic-net, it is shown that this cost function can produce (for LTI systems) sparse input predictions under certain conditions. This characteristic is then shown to result in a control law that is nonlinear, even without constraints. This is in clear contrast with LQ-MPC, the unconstrained solution of which is a constant gain. The explicit solution of \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC for LTI systems is shown to be unique, continuous and piece-wise affine in the control error. The main feature of the control law is an implicit input dead-zone, namely, the regularised actuators being exactly at zero when the control error belongs to a certain neighbourhood of the origin. The shape and extent of this region depend on the cost function as well as the constraints. The explicit solution is computed for a small example to illustrate these properties. The solution path of \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC is then shown to be also piece-wise affine, and it is computed by means of a single multi-parametric quadratic program.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marco Gallieri"", ids = ""46526600"")",,,,,65-83
fa18ddc701483807c53f1f44bcbf9fd243faa02e,Integrated Analysis of the Functions and Prognostic Values of RNA Binding Proteins in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Dysregulation of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) has been found in a variety of cancers and is related to oncogenesis and progression. However, the functions of RBPs in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) remain unclear. In this study, we obtained gene expression data and corresponding clinical information for LUSC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, identified aberrantly expressed RBPs between tumors and normal tissue, and conducted a series of bioinformatics analyses to explore the expression and prognostic value of these RBPs. A total of 300 aberrantly expressed RBPs were obtained, comprising 59 downregulated and 241 upregulated RBPs. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially expressed RBPs were mainly associated with mRNA metabolic processes, RNA processing, RNA modification, regulation of translation, the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Nine RBP genes (A1CF, EIF2B5, LSM1, LSM7, MBNL2, RSRC1, TRMU, TTF2, and ZCCHC5) were identified as prognosis-associated hub genes by univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Kaplanâ€“Meier survival, and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and were used to construct the prognostic model. Further analysis demonstrated that high risk scores for patients were significantly related to poor overall survival according to the model. The area under the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve of the prognostic model was 0.712 at 3 years and 0.696 at 5 years. We also developed a nomogram based on nine RBP genes, with internal validation in the TCGA cohort, which showed a favorable predictive efficacy for prognosis in LUSC. Our results provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of LUSC. The nine-RBP gene signature showed predictive value for LUSC prognosis, with potential applications in clinical decision-making and individualized treatment.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Li"", ids = ""153021253""); list(name = ""Xue Li"", ids = ""143658353""); list(name = ""Li-Na Gao"", ids = ""1499243422""); list(name = ""Chong-Ge You"", ids = ""31099097"")",,e1aa9b34799a6d90ae096fa5546ec9dcbb092ca2; 7ff23a6ffd95ded7e3290616551a68dff8b5780a; 6d4107d1fecdaadc4f4dd5f4cc030ab05b0cde30; 7c8e5024a74d514f184057b4e1666114d41ab4d2; f4b294448ff41303a2832a68268c59df90c92f03; 0eff5ff1cef114a55726b65ce4d5be7f92cc5a9f; bd9d7679ac986520d8af63427c1e2c4c6d81e198; e244706a168828e3eb8db361a10d210cf6cc018c; 958ff924204e1a75d52d4de92d2516caef9d9a52; a150abd4cfc6ccbab6b928bc0f504176b2b4d997; 1b6d2c08e5b0b7ec50366b0175d266ed37ab7d77; 99649284503c2abe6871ae45f3dbf394a3a86352; 1aae8f6c36a5f03c0429f5b059e575ee0eef18f9; 378f2df2447d9a7d431b8b7cefe4131730f8e284; 070a26d706b7c373c157f6a21328b9b71246d294; 3d51af7f2a539788768c91f3aed8b294af36624c; 412c354cedc526863309b7f15204de16092be2ab; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; b3ecd09fe71587f583e84cedbd18b4629b4f17d1; c520dcd646e110218107a6276be0a153ae81b8be; bef3b2e2c7f6523f27ba7d0ba25bdcc542fff10e; 3d2eccd41d3543d69bd7f4cb88096841ec8ec918; 8429b20c189cb43f2a508b90d868cf91296b8300; 0b4d71132dde1743352c73aaa610d86815e35e8d; 999a56b021787f5fafb6c0b82f8a27425e137abe; f48266512c780f65873a6b824261712897f40f25; e0a11e73f9808ea5b49ca294ffb66fc7b29e1f3a; 05454fa718edeb0c22f3b843a058b6793caad64f; 7d4ff6475771190ad9ea8e1a3394222e7f46ed56; dcd74588de3236cd8a01a3adbd4238e9b28b0ab7; 9e27dfede6556698f2ed76382faaa4ec590830f8; 5fa90d52eb552e845de31df4297f34bd6758eb2f; 47ae94d080604d5935d4d622a19ea73f30faaf84; 060687582639001ee272ed73db0ac429fdec92e1; 6b12ed47d5718d1e7b99ac9541aa5a0ee9bf5116,Frontiers in Genetics,11,
aa507c172681b5f98d3c9d1977e44fca0aa5ec66,Abstract 3228: Using paired tissue and serum samples to characterize human lung cancer metabolomics with 1H HRMAS MRS.,"Purpose: We used high resolution magic angle spinning proton MRS to identify metabolomic profiles of lung cancer tissue and serum samples. Previous studies have reported that profiles for lung cancer tissue may be predictive of the profiles of matched serum samples. We further searched correlations of metabolomic data with traditional histopathology from the same tissue samples, and identified serum lung cancer metabolomic markers based on matched tissue analysis. Methods: Paired tissue and serum samples from 107 patients of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 29 serum samples from control subjects without lung disease, were analyzed. MR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600 MHz (14.1T) and pre-cooled to 4Â°C. A 4mm zirconia rotor was used with inserts to create a 10Î¼l sample space, and D 2 O was added for 2 H field locking. Rotor spinning rate was regulated and verified by measuring the inter-SSB distances from spectra with an accuracy of 1.0Hz. A repetition time of 5s and 128 transients were used to acquire each spectrum. Spectra were collected with a spinning rate of 3600Hz, with a rotor synchronized CPMG filter to reduce broad resonances. Spectra were analyzed by an in-house MatLab based program. After spectroscopy, tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into sets of 5Î¼m sections at 100Î¼m intervals, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Volume percentages of histological features (cancer, stroma, necrosis, lymphatic structures, and cartilage) were quantified by a pathologist. Results: We used Lasso, a feature selection method using L1 regularized linear regression, to select a subset of peaks from the spectral results to build a linear model to predict AC/SCC readings. A 2-peak model (peaks at 2.14-2.10 and 0.89-0.89 ppm) has been identified as the most optimal model, and the predicted probability from this model agrees well with the AC/SCC readings. We used the same procedure to build predictive models for quantitative histopathology readings from serum and tissue samples. Out of the four histopathology readings (%Cancer, %Fibrosis/ Inflammation, %Necrosis and %Cartilage), we were able to build a model for %Fibrosis/Inflammation (p =1E-5) using 3 peaks from serum samples (peaks at 2.09-2.03, 1.33-1.32 and 3.27-3.24), and a model for %cancer cells (p =0.002) using one peak from tissue samples (peak at 3.73-3.71). Further data analyses are still underway. Conclusions: These preliminary results, showing the potential to predict AC/SCC status with metabolomic profiles from serum, could have important implications in the screening for lung cancer. If patients could be identified by suspicious serum metabolomic profiles, and subsequently undergo more advanced imaging, lung cancer could be diagnosed at an earlier stage where effective treatment and a good prognosis is more likely.

420caeef657febbeaf7800c6eeb0a299d9115358,Inference of gene regulatory networks by integrating gene expressions and genetic perturbations,"To elucidate the overall relationships between gene expressions and genetic perturbations, many approaches for SNPs to be involved in gene regulatory network (GRNs) inference have been suggested. In the most of the inferences of networks named as SNP-Gene Regulatory Networks (SGRNs) inference, pairs of SNP-gene are still separately given by performing eQTL mappings but eQTLs are not identified during network constructions. In order to build a SGRN for a given set of genes and SNPs without pre-defined eQTL information, we propose a method that is based on a structural equation model. The method consists of three steps: (i) ridge regression, (ii) elastic net regression, and (iii) iterative adaptive lasso regression. In the inference, it is assumed that each gene has a single unknown eQTL. The first two steps are to remove false positive edges keeping as many true positive edges as possible, and then lastly, final edges are selected by iterative adaptive lasso regression that iteratively gives more weight to the edge whose coefficient value is relatively high. To evaluate the performance, the method is applied to data that is randomly generated from the simulated networks and parameters. The method is also applied to psychiatric disorder data. There are three main contributions in this work. First, the proposed method provides both the gene regulatory inference and the identification of eQTL that affect genes in the network. Second, the simulation result proves that an integrative approach of multiple regression methods can effectively detect true edges as well as filter false positive edges. Lastly, it is demonstrated by applying it to psychiatric disorder data that our inference without eQTL information can discover the SGRNs that partially confirms eQTLs identified by our previous work.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dong-Chul Kim"", ids = ""2894767""); list(name = ""Chunyu Liu"", ids = ""2899716""); list(name = ""Xiaoyong Wu"", ids = ""4886601""); list(name = ""Baoju Zhang"", ids = ""7504212""); list(name = ""Jean Gao"", ids = ""37986976"")",,c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ec1eb30c82817237e1008f82102d3b0a59ac02f5; 8fc1d380d4aa32501f5b9b2bcd4240a63cfe6c12; 4dca10776e77af12ba2c8a332ff152d04f025089; 36bd9ee518629b2e2ef03eb5a4fc0aadeafd2aae; 4f20828f487b093898c989f1043cb0d81b583d5e; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; c27e16cf9b626e983ad6372a25e98e060053afcb; 90458d4d78ddeef51f55f4b4707fc9280426ef7d; fe5fa066271a1873819b797cadb8fda7fc794b54; 4d6f221eb494da7acb4d725fc7b51013b74d03cc,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,,182-187

A simple and efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm was developed for posterior inference using a scale mixture of uniform representation of the Bayesian bridge prior. This is the first work to discuss regularized quantile regression with the bridge penalty.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between all MDS-UPDRS components and HRQoL in a representative international cohort of PD patients. Methods We collected demographic and disease-related data as well as MDS-UPDRS and PDQ8 scales. Data were analyzed using two hierarchical multiple regressions, first between the MDS-UPDRS Parts scores and PDQ8 and second between individual items from those Parts demonstrating significant relationship to PDQ8 in the first regression. LASSO regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between PDQ8 and all individual MDS-UPDRS items. Results A total of 3206 PD patients were included in the study. In the first regression analysis PDQ8 was significantly related to MDS-UPDRS parts I and II, but not III and IV. In the second regression model significant contributions to PDQ8 were found for Part I items Fatigue, Pain, Depressed mood, Apathy; and Part II items Dressing, Doing hobbies, Freezing, Speech and Tremor.

Effective results can be obtained from formal runs by planning ahead the effort and cost that are required for them. Additionally estimating in-advance the expected formal's complexity promotes a lot of potential tricks and clever setup techniques to overcome the initial push-button capacity limitation of the formal verifies and improve their capabilities to handle designs with higher complexity. This paper illustrates the application of regression machine learning (ML) techniques to build an estimation model for the cost of formal verification. Up to 10,000 formal verification runs on RTL designs with good varieties of design/properties attributes are used to learn the relationship between HW designs and the final formal cost in terms of formal run time. We demonstrate the use of Ridge-Regression to decide on the bias-variance trade-off during the regression-model design step as well as the application of Lasso-Regression for the feature selection phase. Finally a comparison between the proposed multiple linear regression approach and another non-parametric K-nearest neighbors kernel based regression technique is done to conclude on the presented work. Our results indicate how the proposed model managed to estimate with reasonable error ratio the expected formal verification effort for new-to-verify HW designs.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Eman El Mandouh"", ids = ""2761116""); list(name = ""Amr G.

While opioids play a critical role in the management of cancer pain, the ongoing opioid epidemic has raised concerns regarding their persistent use and abuse. We lack data-driven tools in oncology to understand the risk of adverse opioid-related outcomes. This project seeks to identify clinical risk factors and create a risk score to help identify patients at risk of persistent opioid use and abuse.


METHODS
Within a cohort of 106,732 Veteran cancer survivors diagnosed between 2000 and 2015, we determined rates of persistent post-treatment opioid use, diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence, and admissions for opioid toxicity. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify patient, cancer, and treatment risk factors associated with adverse opioid-related outcomes. Predictive risk models were developed and validated using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression technique.


RESULTS
The rate of persistent opioid use in cancer survivors was 8.3% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰8.1 - 8.4%), the rate of opioid abuse or dependence was 2.9% (95%CI=2.8-3.0%), and the rate of opioid-related admissions was 2.1% (95%CI=2.0-2.2%). On multivariable analysis, several patient, demographic, cancer and treatment factors were associated with risk of persistent opioid use. Predictive models showed a high level of discrimination when identifying individuals at risk of adverse opioid-related outcomes including persistent opioid use (area under curve [AUC]= 0.85), future diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence (AUC=0.87) and admission for opioid abuse or toxicity (AUC=0.78).


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the potential to predict adverse opioid-related outcomes among cancer survivors. With further validation, personalized risk stratification approaches could guide management when prescribing opioids in cancer patients.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucas K Vitzthum"", ids = ""80821493""); list(name = ""Paul Riviere"", ids = ""39905914""); list(name = ""Paige Sheridan"", ids = ""153259370""); list(name = ""Vinit Nalawade"", ids = ""144559493""); list(name = ""Rishi Deka"", ids = ""40523528""); list(name = ""Timothy J.

We examined the influence of race, sociocultural factors, and processâ€ofâ€care factors on initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy in a racially diverse sample. Patients and Methods Eligible women were originally recruited for the Narrowing the Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006â€2011). Sociocultural and processâ€ofâ€care factors were collected via telephone surveys before adjuvant therapy. Clinical factors were abstracted from charts. Penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with initiation. Results Of the 270 women, 55.6% were black and the rest were white. Most women (74.8%) initiated therapy. A significant interaction (P = .008) was found between race and age. Black women aged â‰¤ 50 years had the lowest initiation (59.7%) compared to black women > 50 years (87.1%), white women â‰¤ 50 years (73.7%), or white women > 50 years (72.0%). Multivariate analysis found that younger black women exhibited a marginally higher risk of noninitiation compared to older black women. Additionally, ratings of financial access, presence of comorbidities, and levels of communication were all associated with endocrine therapy initiation. Conclusion Black women â‰¤ 50 years of age and women with financial constraints may be important subgroups for interventions. Patientâ€“provider communication appears to be an important leverage point to foster therapy uptake. Microâ€Abstract Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is recommended for women diagnosed with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer. AET reduces breast cancer recurrence and morality. Black women have high rates of breast cancer morality and recent reports suggest that black women with HR positive disease have higher breast cancer mortality than white women with HR positive disease. Thus, initiation of AET may be particularly important for black women with HR positive breast cancer. Information about the impact of race on initiation of AET is limited and has been inconsistent. This study focused on 270 black (n = 150) and white (n = 120) women with HR positive breast cancer. We found that the initiation of chemotherapy was related to a combination of womanâ€™s age and race rather than just her race alone. Black women (â‰¤50 years old) had the lowest rate of AET initiaiton 59.7%. The proportional representation of Black and White women in our study may have aided our ability to examine differences within subgroups rather than just between Blacks and Whites which highlights the need for diverse study samples.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vanessa B.

To determine the usefulnessof voiding diary (VD), uroflowmetry with electromyography(UF-EMG), bladder wall thickness (before micturition)(VWTUS) and residual urine (PVR) (ultrasound measure)in predicting the outcome of the first endoscopic treatment(1ENDT) of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children> 3 years.


METHODS
Cross-sectional ambispective study of 48children with vesicoureteral reflux. Those with previousendoscopic treatment, age or neurological abnormalities and a history of urethralor abdominal surgery were excluded. The outcomevariable was the correctness (by isotopic cystography)three months after 1ENDT. Univariate and multivariateanalyses were performed through a Multilayer Perceptronnetwork and a logistic regression model EmpiricalBayesian penalized type LASSO Elastic net. Diagnosticaccuracy were determined.


RESULTS
Mean age of the sample was 6.8 +/- 2.28years. The rate of VUR correction after 1ENDT was 77%.The variables selected by both methods were: VD-retentionist(OR 3.90), high PVR (OR 2.69), high VWTUS (OR4.44). Normal UF-EMG was a preventive variable (OR0.38). Diagnostic accuracy (pSp=48.7%), UF+EMG (Se=27.3%(Se=72.7% (AUC=0.8 cut point 20 ml),VWTUS (Se=81.8% (AUC=0.8 cut point4.6 mm). There were no statistical differences betweenPVR and VWTUS. Combined use of UF+EMG+PVR(Se=90.9%in predicting the persistence of VUR after 1ENDT inchildren > 3 years. After screening with a VD, UF-EMG+ RPM combination could be useful to detect these patientsand propose a treatment that improves bladdervoiding function prior to surgery.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""JosÃ© Antonio March-Villalba"", ids = ""7361440""); list(name = ""L.

ca63037ffeb7bbf9d99fde1c7ab4520c7684f0b5,Robust Nonparametric Regression via Sparsity Control With Application to Load Curve Data Cleansing,"Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers-that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an l0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the l0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators.",2012,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gonzalo Mateos"", ids = ""144328356""); list(name = ""Georgios B.

9ed1bede684331e612c32c35315b1c92f7875f26,Functional Movement Screen Items Predict Dynamic Balance Under Military Torso Load.,"INTRODUCTION
Musculoskeletal injuries threaten military readiness and impose a significant financial burden. The functional movement screen (FMS), a 7-item, preparticipation screening tool, may aid in identifying compensatory movement patterns that can hinder physical performance and lead to injuries in active-duty military personnel. The primary aim of our study was to determine if items scores from the traditional FMS or a modified FMS (mFMS) obtained under loaded conditions can predict dynamic balance scores while wearing a military load.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty physically active adults (19 males and 11 females) who qualified for Army basic training completed unloaded and loaded FMS testing. Loaded balance was assessed using the Y balance test and the Biodex balance system. The mFMS and both loaded balance assessment protocols included a military load consisting of a standard issue rucksack (M.O.L.L.E.), kevlar helmet, and weighted vest (massÂ =Â 24.2Â kg).


RESULTS
mFMS item scores were significantly lower than FMS scores for six of the seven movement items. Both FMS and mFMS composite scores were correlated with Y balance scores (FMS: rÂ =Â 0.53, PÂ =Â 0.003; mFMS: rÂ =Â 0.37, PÂ =Â 0.043). Participants with higher composite scores (â‰¥15) outperformed those with lower composite scores (â‰¤14) for the FMS (PÂ =0.006, dÂ =Â 1.16) and mFMS (PÂ =Â 0.031, dÂ =Â 0.75). Lasso penalized regression analyses revealed that (1) higher unloaded in-line lunge subscores predicted better Y balance scores, (2) loaded trunk stability push-up scores of three predicted worse balance on the Biodex, and (3) unloaded and loaded shoulder mobility scores of 3 predicted better performance on the Biodex balance system.


CONCLUSIONS
The in-line lunge subscore from the FMS was the strongest predictor of torso-loaded balance, and the FMS may be more appropriate than a torso-loaded FMS battery when predicting torso-loaded balance among adults with body composition and fitness profiles similar to those of entering military recruits. These findings provide evidence supporting the use of the conventional FMS to identify active-duty personnel who exhibit greater balance deficits and may develop related musculoskeletal injuries while performing operational tasks that require the transport of heavy loads over long distances.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric M Scudamore"", ids = ""115437826""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

In contrast to previous methods that totally separate dynamics at different tag times for identification, the method focuses on imposing appropriate structural constraints on the linear time-invariant (LTI) reformulation of LTP systems. This method adopts a periodically-switched truncated infinite impulse response model for LTP systems, where the structural constraints are interpreted as the requirement to place the poles of the non-truncated models at the same locations for all sub-models. This constraint is imposed by combining the atomic norm regularization framework for LTI systems with the group lasso technique in regression. As a result, the estimated system is both uniform and low-order, which is hard to achieve with other existing estimators. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the grouped atomic norm method does not only show better results compared to other regularized methods, but also outperforms the subspace identification method under high noise levels in terms of model fitting.",2020,Mathematics; Engineering; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mingzhou Yin"", ids = ""65930371""); list(name = ""Andrea Iannelli"", ids = ""3491346""); list(name = ""Mohammad Khosravi"", ids = ""51462618""); list(name = ""Anilkumar Parsi"", ids = ""1420561417""); list(name = ""Roy S.

Due to overfitting and multicollinearity, linear regression estimates often suffer from numerical instability when the amount of predictors is large. In this research, I compare regularized regression methods that are developed to alleviate the consequences of multicollinearity and overfitting, such as ridge regression and lasso. I combine these methods with an outlier detection algorithm, developed by Rousseeuw & Van den Bossche (2016), that is capable of finding outlying cells and rows in highdimensional data sets, taking correlations between variables into account. With this combination, high-dimensional regression estimates are found that are robust to both rowwise and cellwise outliers.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Luuk Maasakkers"", ids = ""104038132"")",,c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; f11c33e4d13e87a3c4b830d9e51f6de11904e4ed; f66b104fe6a29f680fdae13f26e106fc9950619c; 5d5d5df840768d0104244c0b2e9d4f9daa4904c7; 8091181fc405c8aa8416adaffd0e0a2d11dafe86; 98dfa9681cee7c546bbc8b00d3046f9a1349ab69; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; f2f95f1a24ffeced62caaf4c486326f42514f660; bc03054beddc777a06429c7cf75573a077db1674; 99eb3005e85f1528269aa09b5417d6ce51a33c87; ba4ba6ed79a94bdb9ed313995e199774254ef059; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; c87d57da3b1f2b467ef4995d30df832ee2281107; 4196bf0ff0b1a686095698af24fd400f393cff1e; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6,,,
78c631f2bed484aaea463957111511d247199fce,Sparse identification for nonlinear optical communication systems : SINO method,"We introduce a low complexity machine learning method method (based on lasso regression, which promotes sparsity, to identify the interaction between symbols in different time slots and to select the minimum number relevant perturbation terms that are employed) for nonlinearity mitigation. The immense intricacy of the problem calls for the development of ""smart"" methodology, simplifying the analysis without losing the key features that are important for recovery of transmitted data. The proposed sparse identification method for optical systems (SINO) allows to determine the minimal (optimal) number of degrees of freedom required for adaptive mitigation of detrimental nonlinear effects. We demonstrate successful application of the SINO method both for standard fiber communication links (over 3 dB gain) and for fewmode spatial-division-multiplexing systems. c Â© 2016 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (060.2330) Fiber optics communications; (190.4370) Nonlinear optics, fibers.

While there are many works working on sparse coding and dictionary learning, none of them has exploited the advantages of the marginal regression and the lasso simultaneously to provide more efficient and effective solutions. In our work, we provide such an approach with a theoretical support. Therefore, the computational complexity of the proposed method can be two orders faster than that of the lasso with sacrificing the inevitable quantization error. On the other hand, the proposed method is more robust than the conventional marginal regression based methods. We also provide an adaptive regularization parameter selection scheme and a dictionary learning method incorporated with the proposed sparsity estimation algorithm. Experimental results and detailed model analysis are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tzu-Yi Hung"", ids = ""34985695""); list(name = ""Jiwen Lu"", ids = ""1697700""); list(name = ""Yap-Peng Tan"", ids = ""1689805""); list(name = ""Shenghua Gao"", ids = ""1702868"")",797bd9d051cd9fc38e56cbe2a5b247822dc541f8; 01ea10e0cce87232332acdeaef13340832f6b80f,a69ce6862603f81c8f74beadcbf69fd09503ef7d; 64e36f641bbe859613e634bab665d313dd8d7d7b; 6dbaff29d3898cf60f63f5a34cb9610ebb75220c; 273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; ccd1282aea3cc7c3d40300d82472fc5f9f54cb8e; 3424286d6d39de51080ddd683646565545d015e2; c0a27dd14832dc00ffb4c659d3f675333654bf0a; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d5eec41043d91964879c4c745c7165f823967f29; e64a9960734215e2b1866ea3cb723ffa5585ac14; 62a134740314b4469c83c8921ae2e1beea22b8f5; f15780fdafb555f306e29df9a87ebc5793c6b6a1; 7a2252ccce2b65abc3759149b5c06587cc318e2f; 0f86767732f76f478d5845f2e59f99ba106e9265; 15d16234413880889ae5eb6a2e02b662245adb7c; db34d106ea2d3403a3d9ccf22cc80d079772d7c8; 869171b2f56cfeaa9b81b2626cb4956fea590a57; 4eb130a05b2fc9cad0bd97fd85500a71ad5cbd66; bb6b14397f69bbfbc52cbd1a04bc6302a8b938d7; d2fb2fa53021b2776da0fb8b53c54820ed3982cc; 99b6f85501abfda2b28fde5f05df3792cd91f923; 1e9396a24a88544bbd5460c43d6c4a4e793edd02; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 4f0aedbd0b5cb5939449da41579c93b98048fcdc; b480f6a3750b4cebaf1db205692c8321d45926a2; f0000080797f56da5d5beb961b3c01e7cbcfa838; da49da39e5927d9c065ca2f560199f44f235bbe1; 320caf8d8ae63331d48ed2d824aa0c13d0af3617,,,578-592

In this work, we use a Gaussian process prior for the unknown nonparametric link function and a Laplace distribution on the index vector, with the latter motivated by the recent popularity of the Bayesian lasso idea. We design a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. Careful consideration of the singularity of the kernel matrix, and tractability of some of the full conditional distributions leads to a partially collapsed approach where the nonparametric link function is integrated out in some of the sampling steps. Our simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the Bayesian method versus the frequentist approach.

3b444309c19348387e2c2948b6680201fe315fa4,CT-based radiomic model predicts high grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE
To compare the predictive models that can incorporate a set of CT image features for preoperatively differentiating the high grade (Fuhrman III-IV) from low grade (Fuhrman I-II) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fourteen patients with ccRCC treated with a partial or radical nephrectomy were enrolled in the training cohort. The six non-texture features, including Pseudocapsule, Round mass, maximal tumor diameter (Diametermax), intratumoral artery (Arterytumor), enhancement value of the tumor (TEV) and relative TEV (rTEV), were assessed for each tumor. The texture features were extracted from the CT images of the section with the largest area of renal mass at both corticomedullary and nephrographic phases. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to screen the most valuable texture features to calculate a texture score (Texture-score) for each patient. A logistic regression model was used in the training cohort to discriminate the high from low grade ccRCC at nephrectomy. The predictors would include all non-texture features in Model 1, all non-texture features and Texture-score in Model 2, and Texture-score in Model 3. The performance of the predictive models were tested and compared in an independent validation cohort composed of 92 cases with ccRCC.


RESULTS
Inter-rater agreement was good for each non-texture feature and Texture-score (the concordance correlation coefficient or Kappa coefficientâ€¯>â€¯0.70). The Texture-score was calculated via a linear combination of the 4 selected texture features. The three models shown good discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC in the training cohort and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.826 in Mode 1, 0.878 in Model 2 and 0.843 in Model 3, and a significant different AUC was found between Model 1 and Model 2. Application of the predictive models in the validation cohort still gave a discrimination (AUCâ€¯>â€¯0.670), and the Texture-score based models with or without the non-texture features (Model 2 and 3) showed a better discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05).


CONCLUSION
This study presented the Texture-score based models can facilitate the preoperative discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiule Ding"", ids = ""5869632""); list(name = ""Zhaoyu Xing"", ids = ""5445980""); list(name = ""Zhenxing Jiang"", ids = ""5684433""); list(name = ""Jie Chen"", ids = ""39029896""); list(name = ""Liang Pan"", ids = ""38559468""); list(name = ""Jianguo Qiu"", ids = ""4557842""); list(name = ""Wei Xing"", ids = ""2212808"")",7f30d6e2253b679c83fd7fb58253f73b1e0d2f40; e15e6582ab88751328600510af536a6564877009; f0da2f2435f57d7da76c90e8abd3036a5c4f297d; a16803f5e3863919a85f9fd662925ffc5bcafa90; aa05ef502deadcb01cfa81f45bd42091703aa293; 747e6712f0d8d9aac66a84bd4940ef0968c6b342; efa5c8892a9903ab068a0716a77dbbb20fa85833; 40386f30139bd149ca1d5706307bc7610c1d9dc8; 3ff62cf4551bc610f25b86e464d6a5f77f005fcb; 66ba5f0881f6d2bf4292d9927796e185623d688e; 84bd329cc149f7f137efb7a4c124f98045f4fcec; b2d1de183b6b135a9804a656e5f285f40578b492; 4015ed12508b7db0633de10e534d339b3ca721f1; e4841f064f676fd18c06d82b8256654460038b40; a82e27ea05a623d15ac508e4fc14987ad1ef392f; a45cb60248e47d1ca7b43e9d4ba0a71251939563; 634a8f1d2223e6006205c8a37835d01e35389165; 4d0afb9e09063e2e9edf46be6fedef23feee3c2b; ae2867d9dc97bed8520b44b6eed24d26683edf07; 64dbbeb4ed20b8f6312a38fd7af3c39ee697f5f2; 107ebadc031606aaf1d727f2cf6bff5ea9dc64bf; 315595c830b5caeb382885e9d2b823ffe07a6c6a,8fd1d81f8f229f4078bb4361493abf7e62e1e70a; 36c1043c9b5338d988d91173d6bc6f57d5a1fe8c; cbb2114ba499093e29a653c80839fd66ff4c03f4; f50d9b6d96f1cbe6f3f04147376414744e0c9953; 92bd46b27a5c98f1c1d5c8a093e6960f6c718e44; cc021584e3407e9fd86dca454e4cc0b21daa6098; ba5e6674bfe4cd0d81eb1957216e393ef09489df; 03779e77a5d5dcc5e71d98dc612cf985f6f733b0; 7cb3386c4a4da37b142df9daa9a432fb6f3fe8f9; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; 856ac3df0a5a2470e20b6a3cefe4ba4272f3788c; 5b7e07a54ea1ee584093e3f7751a0d1302d7c974; cd82b85a71695d38899f0b6e25e87de8e3ea2120; 3bf7bea34daea2552f5cc1696d03ce61f82c502e; b70763c4da7178c036abcdd0b70fe4382f285964; 4d0a61f7ab702b128f36a04499f4757f45d00899; 397a07074735d3534a1ce379353d5891a9e95d08; aa5147b4eadbc7c2a0abeec3834be30fe654d070; 6bfb3d11bedfcbbbcc433ec4be0e8a1ba83376b3; 3c0107fcc7bc815e0aa4c133fe4ebc9d31d090eb; df32faa7a40ba677dec8f32240c08d87cb6b8fb7; b8c847acca6cb6d35a334c353b9e882d5aa10d07; 459656237da934b28c61f3e164dbf696aa5a41b2; ff0a1f4cd928169ec319ee93b95a1d38a7853c07; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; a5f1af49e404264ab78d7b3f7f2a76ae21dd24b3; 337faff4403e0a85e82d0d361597a8e21f3b1982; c72a1ecd6f51bc5c1be6e6153187c32a06e337c9; e9a2e55ea5cdab657d7b69ebee568ce6e30d4584; d4a33b9457d9a17e1747afd1d2d546b44cd606e3; 35a1f6601355f4d9bfa95564a75e649408d67ce9; 50270fceb6b2b9f9f943c76745b75f44bb2121b1; 644a3527fa866d2cec886bb46f7adfd51da84af2; 15d34b485135fc6ef8e6e05332bfaa503b0feee8; cf9c546f33bb55edb45ffa07fdaf7207b39552e7; 6a0ea15e65c4f1fe6b6f084b2c613933a4ecb7e2,European journal of radiology,103,"
