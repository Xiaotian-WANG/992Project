Thus, optimal risk stratification is of greatest importance for reasonable choice of treatment and prognostic evaluation. For our study, a total of 1707 samples of AML patients from three public databases were divided into meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets. The meta-training set was used to build risk prediction model, and the other four data sets were employed for validation. By log-rank test and univariate COX regression analysis as well as LASSO-COX, AML patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on AML risk score (AMLRS) which was constituted by 10 survival-related genes. In meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets, the patient in the low-risk group all had a significantly longer OS (overall survival) than those in the high-risk group (PÂ <Â .001), and the area under ROC curve (AUC) by time-dependent ROC was 0.5854-0.7905 for 1Â year, 0.6652-0.8066 for 3Â years and 0.6622-0.8034 for 5Â years. Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that AMLRS was an independent prognostic factor in four data sets. Nomogram combining the AMLRS and two clinical parameters performed well in predicting 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS. Finally, we created a web-based prognostic model to predict the prognosis of AML patients (https://tcgi.shinyapps.io/amlrs_nomogram/).",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zuyi Yang"", ids = ""50109555""); list(name = ""Jun Shang"", ids = ""21498473""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""1471702054""); list(name = ""Liang Zhang"", ids = ""50081174""); list(name = ""Tingting Tang"", ids = ""50149336""); list(name = ""Guoyan Tian"", ids = ""81606838""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Chen"", ids = ""48282941"")",,,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine,24,4510 - 4523

Alternatively, Lasso penalized regression allows one to jointly model the relationship between all genetic variants and the phenotype. However, it is unclear how to best conduct inference on the individual Lasso coefficients, especially in high-dimensional settings.MethodsWe consider six methods for testing the Lasso coefficients: two permutation (Lasso-Ayers, Lasso-PL) and one analytic approach (Lasso-AL) to select the penalty parameter for type-1-error control, residual bootstrap (Lasso-RB), modified residual bootstrap (Lasso-MRB), and a permutation test (Lasso-PT). Methods are compared via simulations and application to the Minnesota Center for Twins and Family Study.ResultsWe show that for finite sample sizes with increasing number of null predictors, Lasso-RB, Lasso-MRB, and Lasso-PT fail to be viable methods of inference. However, Lasso-PL and Lasso-AL remain fast and powerful tools for conducting inference with the Lasso, even in high-dimensions.ConclusionOur results suggest that the proposed permutation selection procedure (Lasso-PL) and the analytic selection method (Lasso-AL) are fast and powerful alternatives to the standard univariate analysis in genome-wide association studies.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jaron Arbet"", ids = ""37243712""); list(name = ""M K Mcgue"", ids = ""2941423""); list(name = ""Snigdhansu Chatterjee"", ids = ""3029253""); list(name = ""Saonli Basu"", ids = ""22448049"")",7426d7a695eec308e9d0089dc37e86fe4dd0267e; 388a13dfbde0f6bdfcc5f6bdcf49926be9fc64db; 3f9e716b9beadf8b6c72bafb856133e1d23d7758; 749a932efd1feea749ca27d66dd06e2365ab91c9; 57f1d4588111e59762fe459abad9f825303eda51,59a45558657e93aed40a2f5c73bbd50a8d76dda0; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; 802bd99d39a504e4b75fdf2a87f4f67d16836f64; 300ae1297ef21fd7c7a029c7911f1d04f78a6922; 8b160a6d2eaa04dd6773be0d233a26621d839da4; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; dc965cec5e17db39602a8924eb1dcfc8af894d74; 0efd63ecb2d9f6c7bac14890e8f2974bcc2517e6; c80c7f1791e1053de929000f7861b6c560caf271; 75f8a4d7ed6a0f32fa098cac967de247938d9ce5; 9c445e726cb8ca9c05312f9642c2129d8396d71b; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 2655956b9202cac10c5837337a7d94d5afd73a54; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 99ab1e6a1195e772757d40c49cd7847c253f0313; 5f5bbfc164ffde5a124b738fd0de6f3c1e34a390; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; 721d4d33ca29c6e3ed440a9dfe5799187d43f7fc; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; bfc871e0e727433cb9ad5c90bccc9291ae246f61; 1d85191f9a268bb7a3d6e00197fd8e50fb1e9870; 490f006770423af9c610ec9ca52517c00392c9d2; bbad772843c1a55b2e94ea504e6c89c9b4229776; 4c249af517778c96d4a3196358ee9cf614c4bfe5; ae36e470228cda57b64180f5705e960afa7dfcb0; 2ac89d4db44a965d3682e45d1e209ea353d23f2b; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; a9dd1815e09009df25e1be82f719ce95bd75de7b; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; d56ae226b933ad197d627e43857adfcaa50423d0; ac0cd0ba89d33a3c05e81624c686f9b425c70b86,BMC Genetics,18,
e26cdb253f75667eafc93636d175cb870fba09e6,Sub-regional pattern analysis of heterogeneous PET tracer distribution employed for disease assessment,"The mean value of the non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) within a region of interest (ROI) is the traditionally-employed metric in neurological image analysis. The ability of the mean value to accurately track clinical disease progression may be limited since it does not capture the spatial pattern of tracer distribution. In this work, we employ the principal component analysis (PCA) to quantify the clinically-relevant tracer binding patterns ([11C]dihydrotetrabenazine) in high-resolution PET images of 37 Parkinson's disease subjects. The principal component (PC) scores that correspond to different binding patterns in the putamen ROIs are combined with the mean BPND and used as the input to several linear models that aim to predict the clinical severity of the disease (disease duration). Multiple regression analysis and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) with cross-validation are used to evaluate the contributions of the PC scores to the accuracy of the tested models. With multiple regression analysis, the value of the adjusted R2 was 0.57 when the mean BPND alone was used as the model input. When the PC scores were included as additional input variables, the value of the adjusted R2 increased to 0.70. The terms of the model representing the PC scores were statistically significant (p<0.01). In LASSO analysis, the cross-validated accuracy improved by 25% when the PC scores were added to the input (compared to using the mean BPND alone). These results demonstrate that a) the disease- and tracer-specific binding patterns can be identified in sub-cortical brain structures from high-resolution PET images, and b) such patterns may facilitate better models of the clinical disease metrics.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ivan S.

However, there are considerable challenges in analyzing largeâ€scale molecular data. Results: We propose new Bayesian hierarchical Cox proportional hazards models, called the spikeâ€andâ€slab lasso Cox, for predicting survival outcomes and detecting associated genes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to fit the proposed models by incorporating Expectationâ€Maximization steps into the extremely fast cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is assessed via extensive simulations and compared with the lasso Cox regression. We demonstrate the proposed procedure on two cancer datasets with censored survival outcomes and thousands of molecular features. Our analyses suggest that the proposed procedure can generate powerful prognostic models for predicting cancer survival and can detect associated genes.

3acb217a0157f4c6fd603fa26b920678b4f0061d,A two-stage sparse logistic regression for optimal gene selection in high-dimensional microarray data classification,"The common issues of high-dimensional gene expression data are that many of the genes may not be relevant, and there exists a high correlation among genes. Gene selection has been proven to be an effective way to improve the results of many classification methods. Sparse logistic regression using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) or using smoothly clipped absolute deviation is one of the most widely applicable methods in cancer classification for gene selection. However, this method faces a critical challenge in practical applications when there are high correlations among genes. To address this problem, a two-stage sparse logistic regression is proposed, with the aim of obtaining an efficient subset of genes with high classification capabilities by combining the screening approach as a filter method and adaptive lasso with a new weight as an embedded method. In the first stage, sure independence screening method as a screening approach retains those genes representing high individual correlation with the cancer class level. In the second stage, the adaptive lasso with new weight is implemented to address the existence of high correlations among the screened genes in the first stage. Experimental results based on four publicly available gene expression datasets have shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, G-mean, area under the curve, and stability. In addition, the results demonstrate that the top selected genes are biologically related to the cancer type. Thus, the proposed method can be useful for cancer classification using DNA gene expression data in real clinical practice.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zakariya Yahya Algamal"", ids = ""3280501""); list(name = ""Muhammad Hisyam Lee"", ids = ""31613132"")",763ae5a46b900efb846e8375c06cffcf4428a1bd; 5751f91e55561a62013acf15fb39b277e13d62be; 0926533cca79d86e2e602acd3dabbbe874fd61aa; 9e6ae53b41d88b9d721d9d698514e7721fdfdaae,,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification,,1-19

In both cases, our objective is to exploit the mean-reverting properties of prices as reported in the literature. This method is an interesting technique for portfolio selection due to its capacity to perform variable selection in linear regression and to solve high-dimensional problems (which is the case if we consider broader indexes such as the SP and Ibovespa - Brazilian market), comprising data from 2010 to 2017. Also, we formed IT portfolios using cointegration (a method widely used for index tracking) to have a basis for comparison of the results using lasso. The findings for IT showed similar overall performance between portfolios using lasso and cointegration, with a slight advantage to cointegration in some cases. Nonetheless, lasso-based IT portfolios presented average monthly turnover at least 40% smaller, indicating that lasso generated portfolios that had not only a consistent tracking performance but also a considerable advantage in terms of transaction costs (represented by the average turnover).",2020,Economics,"list(name = ""Leonardo Riegel Sant'Anna"", ids = ""1402743143""); list(name = ""JoÃ£o F.

In this study, we propose a model through which the vertical movements of the velum are inferred from an acoustic feature set. An X-ray Microbeam data set collected at University of Tokyo is used for the modeling. The data recorded the vertical movements of the velum of 11 American English speakers saying both isolated words and sentences. Velum positions are traced by a metal pallet placed on top of the velum. 40 MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient) features are extracted from the accompanying acoustic signal at each time frame. MFCC features of five frames to both sides of the current frame, together with the current frame, consist of the 440-dimensional feature vector for predicting the velum position of the current frame. The feature vectors are then fitted to a lasso regression model.

Such data are said to follow a monotone missingness pattern, under which the likelihood has a convenient factorization. Upon further assuming that asset returns are multivariate normally distributed, with histories at least as long as the total asset count, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are easily obtained by performing repeated ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, one for each asset. Things get more interesting when there are more assets than historical returns. OLS becomes unstable due to rankâ€“deficient design matrices, which is called a â€œbig p small nâ€ problem.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, which is currently determined in clinical practice by invasive SLN biopsy.


PURPOSE
To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra- and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
1.5T, T1 -weighted DCE-MRI.


ASSESSMENT
A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (âˆ¼67%) and a validation set (âˆ¼33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed.


RESULTS
Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPVâ€‰=â€‰0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPVâ€‰=â€‰0.824).


DATA CONCLUSION
This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.

However, this analytic strategy has not been fully utilized in the PTSD field. The current study utilized network analysis to examine connectedness and strength among PTSD symptoms (employing both partial correlation and regression network analyses) among a community sample of students exposed to the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings. Method: Respondents (N = 4,639) completed online surveys 3â€“4 months postshootings, with PTSD symptom severity measured via the Trauma Symptom Questionnaire. Results: Data were analyzed via adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and relative importance networks, as well as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to identify the shortest path from each symptom to all other symptoms. Relative importance network analysis revealed that intrusive thoughts had the strongest influence on other symptoms (i.e., had many strong connections [highest outdegree]) while computing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm indicated that anger produced the shortest path to all other symptoms (i.e., the strongest connections to all other symptoms). Conclusion: Findings suggest that anger or intrusion likely play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of PTSD (i.e., are more influential within the network than are other symptoms).",2018,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Connor Patrick Sullivan"", ids = ""38563528""); list(name = ""Andrew Charles Smith"", ids = ""50472882""); list(name = ""Michael Lewis"", ids = ""145806130""); list(name = ""Russell T.

We discuss the problem that the current approaches are not capable to find a linear regression model with the desirable properties. Therefore, our goal is to find a procedure that produces a linear regression model which achieves the desirable properties in a reasonable amount of time. We present an algorithmic approach in which the desirable properties are modeled as constraints and through penalties in the objective function of a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) model. The performance of the algorithm is shown on both real and synthetic data sets, and is compared with the widely used Lasso approach from Tibshirani (1996).

476d008f2f74e7c7cb61f8adc2dcdec0d5c0aebc,Evaluating associations between early pregnancy trace elements mixture and 2nd trimester gestational glucose levels: A comparison of three statistical approaches.,"OBJECTIVE
Studies have shown that individual trace element levels might be associated with abnormal glycemic status, with implications for diabetes. Few studies have considered these trace elements as a mixture and their impact on gestational glucose levels. Comparing three statistical approaches, we assessed the associations between essential trace elements mixture and gestational glucose levels.


METHODS
We used data from 1720 women enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Fetal Growth Study, for whom trace element concentrations (zinc, selenium, copper, molybdenum) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using plasma collected during the 1st trimester. Non-fasting glucose levels were measured during the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening test in the 2nd trimester. We applied (1) Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR); (2) adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a mutually adjusted linear regression model; and (3) generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the joint associations between trace elements mixture and glucose levels adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Using BKMR, we observed a mean 2.7Â mg/dL higher glucose level for each interquartile increase of plasma copper (95% credible interval: 0.9, 4.5). The positive association between plasma copper and glucose levels was more pronounced at higher quartiles of zinc. Similar associations were detected using adaptive LASSO and GAM. In addition, results from adaptive LASSO and GAM suggested a super-additive interaction between molybdenum and selenium (both p-valuesÂ =Â 0.04).


CONCLUSION
Employing different statistical methods, we found consistent evidence of higher gestational glucose levels associated with higher copper and potential synergism between zinc and copper on glucose levels.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yinnan Zheng"", ids = ""119715056""); list(name = ""Cuilin Zhang"", ids = ""50445801""); list(name = ""Marc G.

eb457da7affcde2aa991886dbd7a02efaed7139a,Predicting risk of chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia: A pooled analysis in individual patients data with advanced lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVES
Neutropenia is associated with the risk of life-threatening infections, chemotherapy dose reductions and delays that may compromise outcomes. This analysis was conducted to develop a prediction model for chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia in lung cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Individual patient data from existing cooperative group phase II/III trials of stages III/IV non-small cell lung cancer or extensive small-cell lung cancer were included. The data were split into training and testing sets. In order to enhance the prediction accuracy and the reliability of the prediction model, lasso method was used for both variable selection and regularization on the training set. The selected variables was fit to a logistic model to obtain regression coefficients. The performance of the final prediction model was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve in both training and testing sets.


RESULTS
The dataset was randomly separated into training [7606 (67 %) patients] and testing [3746 (33 %) patients] sets. The final model included: age (>65 years), gender (male), weight (kg), BMI, insurance status (yes/unknown), stage (IIIB/IV/ESSCLC), number of metastatic sites (1, 2 or â‰¥3), individual drugs (gemcitabine, taxanes), number of chemotherapy agents (2 or â‰¥3), planned use of growth factors, associated radiation therapy, previous therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery), duration of planned treatment, pleural effusion (yes/unknown), performance status (1, â‰¥2) and presence of symptoms (yes/unknown).


CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a relatively simple model with routinely available pre-treatment variables, to predict for neutropenia.

These studies have successfully identified genetic variants attributed to complex diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Various statistical methods have been developed with the goal of improving power to find disease causing variants. The major focus of this dissertation is to develop statistical methods related to gene mapping studies with its application in real datasets to identify genetic markers associated with complex human diseases. In my first project, I developed a method to detect gene-gene interactions by incorporating linkage disequilibrium (LD) information provided by external datasets such as the International HapMap or the 1000 Genomes Projects. The next two projects in my dissertation are related to the analysis of secondary phenotypes in case-control genetic association studies. In these studies, a set of correlated secondary phenotypes that may share common genetic factors with disease status are often collected. However, due to unequal sampling probabilities between cases and controls, the standard regression approach for examination of these secondary phenotype can yield inflated type I error rates when the test SNPs are associated with the disease. To solve this issue, I propose a Gaussian copula approach to jointly model the disease status and the secondary phenotype. In my second project, I consider only one marker in the model and perform a test to access whether the marker is associated with the secondary phenotype in the Gaussian copula framework. In my third project, I extend the copula-based approach to include a large number of candidate SNPs in the model. I propose a variable selection approach to select markers which are associated with the secondary phenotype by applying a lasso penalty to the log-likelihood function.

We propose an order-constrained version of l1-regularized regression (Lasso) for this problem, and show how to solve it efficiently using the well-known pool adjacent violators algorithm as its proximal operator. The main application of this idea is to time-lagged regression, where we predict an outcome at time t from features at the previous K time points. In this setting, it is natural to assume that the coefficients decay as we move farther away from t, and hence the order constraint is reasonable. Potential application areas include financial time series and prediction of dynamic patient outcomes based on clinical measurements.

8462a8a9e071d17f5ed7c278ec451bd9b10818d5,Application of group smoothly clipped absolute deviation method in identifying correlates of psychiatric distress among college students,"College students are at an increased risk of psychiatric distress. So, identifying its important correlates using more reliable statistical models, instead of inefficient traditional variable selection methods like stepwise regression, is of great importance. The objective of this study was to investigate correlates of psychiatric distress among college students in Iran; using group smoothly clipped absolute deviation method (SCAD). A number of 1259 voluntary college students participated in this cross-sectional study (Jan-May 2016) at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire consisting of demographic information, a behavioral risk factors checklist and the GHQ-28 questionnaire (with a cut-off of 23 to measure psychiatric distress, recommended by the Iranian version of the questionnaire). Penalized logistic regression with a group-SCAD regularization method was used to analyze the data (Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05). The majority of students were aged 18â€“25 (87.61%), and 60.76% of them were female. About 41% of students had psychiatric distress. Significant correlates of psychiatric distress among college students selected by group-SCAD included the average grade, educational level, being optimistic about future, having a boy/girlfriend, having an emotional breakup, the average daily number of cigarettes, substance abusing during previous month and having suicidal thoughts ever (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Penalized logistic regression methods such as group-SCAD and group-Adaptive-LASSO should be considered as plausible alternatives to stepwise regression for identifying correlates of a binary response. Several behavioral variables were associated with psychological distress which highlights the necessity of designing multiple factors and behavioral changes in interventional programs.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mahya Arayeshgari"", ids = ""1666751703""); list(name = ""Leili Tapak"", ids = ""1987345""); list(name = ""Ghodratollah Roshanaei"", ids = ""3483834""); list(name = ""Jalal Poorolajal"", ids = ""1972426""); list(name = ""Ali Ghaleiha"", ids = ""5734521"")",,,BMC Psychiatry,20,

Twenty-five male patients and 72 female patients were analyzed in the study. Peripheral blood samples were taken before and 5 years after the treatment with IFN-Î². Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. The authors compared lymphocyte parameters between confirmed sustained progression (CSP) and non-CSP groups by using Welch's one-way analysis of means or a chi-square test of independence. A penalized (lasso) logistic regression model was fitted to identify the combination of lymphocyte parameters for potential biomarkers. The combination of lymphocyte counts, relative CD3+/CD25+ cells, absolute CD8 T cells, absolute CD8+/CD38+ cells, absolute CD38+ cells, and relative CD5+/CD19+ cells was identified as potential biomarker for the IFN-Î² treatment to monitor MS development in relation to CSP. The results suggest that other biomarkers aid in patient observation, predict a favorable outcome, and assist in the decision-making process for the early therapy escalation.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Martin Valis"", ids = ""2318596""); list(name = ""Oldrich Vysata"", ids = ""2359273""); list(name = ""LulÃ¡Å¡ SobÃ­Å¡ek"", ids = ""66005398""); list(name = ""Blanka Frydrychova Klimova"", ids = ""31491920""); list(name = ""Ctirad AndrÃ½s"", ids = ""3997508""); list(name = ""Doris VokurkovÃ¡"", ids = ""6909241""); list(name = ""ZbyÅ¡ek Pavelek"", ids = ""6787977"")",,,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,39 3,"

Early markers are urgently needed for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. The prospective study determined structural and functional changes in the preterm lung at the time of diagnosis and identified early disease markers by proteome screening in plasma in the first week of life. 40 infants (27.7Â±2.09wks, 984Â±332g) were included for advanced MRI measurements (3-Tesla) and complemented by Infant Lung function testing (ILFT) in spontaneously breathing infants. Plasma samples were processed for proteomic screening by SOMAscanâ„¢. Key findings were confirmed in an independent study cohort (n=21 infants). Statistical analysis used penalized and Poisson regression analysis; for protein analysis confounder effects were subtracted by lasso regression. Statistical analysis confirmed a high correlation of MRI and lung function variables and identified a pattern characterizing changes in the lungs of preterm infants by T2- and T1-weighed image analysis and lung volume measurements as well as ILFT. Functional enrichment analysis showed overrepresentation of the GO categories 9immune function9, 9extracellular matrix9, 9cellular proliferation/migration9, 9organ development9 and 9angiogenesis9 in infants with BPD. One protein was identified as a potential biomarker. We identified a structural pattern characterizing BPD by advanced MRI confirmed by ILFT. The identified protein indicated BPD development in the first week of life enabling personalized treatment strategies.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kai Foerster"", ids = ""100983497""); list(name = ""Steffen Sass"", ids = ""35590801""); list(name = ""Olaf Dietrich"", ids = ""2644912""); list(name = ""Andreas Pomschar"", ids = ""4593123""); list(name = ""Lutz Naehrlich"", ids = ""6753625""); list(name = ""Andreas Schulze"", ids = ""1937469""); list(name = ""Andreas W.

In this paper, we present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i.e., variable selection). For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection algorithm, referred to as the Bolasso, is compared favorably to other linear regression methods on synthetic data and datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.",2008,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Francis R.

2de6c93ad71dbc3504dcf6561966a0f202a0ac37,Descriptive Symbolic Models of Gaits from Parkinson's Disease Patients,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that has many debilitating symptoms which affect the patient's motor system and can cause significant changes in their gait. By using genetic programming, we aim to develop descriptive symbolic nonlinear models of PD patient gait from time series data recorded from pressure sensors under subjects' feet. When compared to popular types of linear regression (OLS and LASSO), the nonlinear models fit their data better and generalize to unseen data significantly better. It was found that models developed for healthy control subjects generalized to other control subjects well, however the models trained on subjects with PD did not generalize well to other PD patients, which complicates the issue of being able to detect the progression of the disease. It is suspected that health care professionals can have difficulty classifying PD due to a lack of accurate data from patient reports; having individually trained models for active monitoring of patients would help in effectively diagnosing PD.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""James Alexander Hughes"", ids = ""48267399""); list(name = ""Sheridan K.

The ordinary logistic regression model fitted turned up to be significant at 1% with a pvalue of 0.000. The significant covariates reveal that age increases the risk of being hypertensive for diabetic patient at 16% per unit change. Weight by 60%, marital status decreases it by 74%, exercising decreases it by 95% and family history also by 59%. Various levels of penalization are used for the elastic net logistic regression have shown reasonable improvement over the ordinary logistic regression, with lasso having least deviance ratio (0.52) but also shrinks eight covariates to zero. This is followed by elastic net with centred penalization, which behaves in a similar manner as lasso, but shrinks six of the covariates to zero (with a deviance ratio of 0.58). Ridge logistic regression and the fixed ridge logistic elastic net both retained all the covariates in the model with values of deviance ratio 0.6 and 0.65 respectively.",2014,,"list(name = ""Asifa Mehraj Baba"", ids = ""17884120""); list(name = ""S.

d267b7c63381f14b25a9446bcf1aedd7680b5295,Predictive Analysis Tool for Predicting Student Performance and Placement Performance using ML algorithms.,"Recently, Predictive Analysis using machine learning and data science has had greater growth in almost every field. Predictive analysis for predicting student performance has always been difficult than other predictions such as House price prediction, stock market prediction, sales prediction, etc., Due to the difficulty in finding and collecting appropriate datasets, especially in college-level education. Since the grading system differs from universities to universities, it is even more difficult to collect proper datasets that can be used as a global dataset, created based on the system that is common to almost every university. In this paper, we have taken this difficult task and created a dataset, which contains student details of over 185 students. The dataset was collected from SRM Valliammai engineering college, it includes the data of 2018 and 2019 passed out students. Other than academic data, the dataset also covers other attributes of the students. The dataset contains around 20 attributes which would improve the accuracy score. Using this dataset our aim is to develop a training model that predicts the final CGPA of a student and also the placement result of the particular student. We have successfully predicted the studentâ€™s final CGPA and their placement result. We have predicted the results using algorithms like Linear Regression (LR1), Decision tree (DT) algorithm, K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), Logistical regression (LR2) and Lasso regression (LR3) algorithm. And we have obtained excellent results with accuracy over 94%. The predicted results are obtained from comparing the accuracy score of the above-given algorithms. The one with the highest accuracy was displayed as the final output.",2020,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Subramanian Mugesh"", ids = ""14897988""); list(name = ""D.

83e95cbc626627deda0c4ca70eb6b5e405a0e78d,Drawing inferences for high-dimensional linear models: A selection-assisted partial regression and smoothing approach.,"Drawing inferences for high-dimensional models is challenging as regular asymptotic theories are not applicable. This article proposes a new framework of simultaneous estimation and inferences for high-dimensional linear models. By smoothing over partial regression estimates based on a given variable selection scheme, we reduce the problem to low-dimensional least squares estimations. The procedure, termed as Selection-assisted Partial Regression and Smoothing (SPARES), utilizes data splitting along with variable selection and partial regression. We show that the SPARES estimator is asymptotically unbiased and normal, and derive its variance via a nonparametric delta method. The utility of the procedure is evaluated under various simulation scenarios and via comparisons with the de-biased LASSO estimators, a major competitor. We apply the method to analyze two genomic datasets and obtain biologically meaningful results.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhe Fei"", ids = ""47806921""); list(name = ""Ji Zhu"", ids = ""36904159""); list(name = ""Moulinath Banerjee"", ids = ""35096678""); list(name = ""Yi Li"", ids = ""51005858"")",25a1363f94a16f6457db49b6b1ea5c935e55e3e8,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 4b63411eb156a3c124965283eb172798fff9f12f; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; ac9203c4cf84e292b542dd381844a4ded98e1616; e3571ce4b136f32017793c202af742bcb44d015b; 19372c3790f0ffaaabf09ed88b84e47ce850134b; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; 5771b4774d5ed5f52a5500508887ac4b3a3f1058; a8f0a8f95eb672aef8f8d2d535af4e500dd0d9a1; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 458dbdfa7ad609b8dfda40d8603fb77f6b4fc53d; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 0504b9c90fbd9883c051ae8d9a5097b0cb42be47; 762af2bb36e91b19cd426d6ab705edf6bbe61cc5; f1571bd16d42e25672c0875ed62f9df3886f6883; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 574753071c85f6484f049305744d669c37c6a9d4; 12f2c475b6f64f4bd1349b2190b75f5013a40033; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; aa5f030edd0055fc9cb6f87d2514bddbc52347c7; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; ebd3379c1f1b245b3f4b04a03881fbc2c4e504f8; d0488115fc020e6ef18a3971bf28d6eab195ffac; 372b141a8c59ccd48c413caf3b64c718751b253e; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 58bf27d8aa5c12b9db05aa556c61159536e9d385; 10f29a0a97766adca58692294272f62f9b8f0bc0; ac7973079135dd5b0b7f470070960f221aa23b30; fe96483ba3f34ca4565e81a5cb130f66c02cf681,Biometrics,,

Under a sparsity scenario, Bickel et al. (2009) showed that the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior, and derived oracle inequalities for the prediction risk in the general nonparametric regression model, as well as bounds on the L_p estimation loss in the linear model. The Assumption RE (s,m,c) and Assumption RE (s,c) play a significant role in their paper. In this paper, the assumptions equivalent with Assumption RE and Assumption RE are given.

0bd20c387bec8c851e2d787c9d379af7c5ec29b8,Genome-wide prediction of discrete traits using bayesian regressions and machine learning,"BackgroundGenomic selection has gained much attention and the main goal is to increase the predictive accuracy and the genetic gain in livestock using dense marker information. Most methods dealing with the large p (number of covariates) small n (number of observations) problem have dealt only with continuous traits, but there are many important traits in livestock that are recorded in a discrete fashion (e.g. pregnancy outcome, disease resistance). It is necessary to evaluate alternatives to analyze discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context.MethodsThis study shows two threshold versions of Bayesian regressions (Bayes A and Bayesian LASSO) and two machine learning algorithms (boosting and random forest) to analyze discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context. These methods were evaluated using simulated and field data to predict yet-to-be observed records. Performances were compared based on the models' predictive ability.ResultsThe simulation showed that machine learning had some advantages over Bayesian regressions when a small number of QTL regulated the trait under pure additivity. However, differences were small and disappeared with a large number of QTL. Bayesian threshold LASSO and boosting achieved the highest accuracies, whereas Random Forest presented the highest classification performance. Random Forest was the most consistent method in detecting resistant and susceptible animals, phi correlation was up to 81% greater than Bayesian regressions. Random Forest outperformed other methods in correctly classifying resistant and susceptible animals in the two pure swine lines evaluated. Boosting and Bayes A were more accurate with crossbred data.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that the best method for genome-wide prediction may depend on the genetic basis of the population analyzed. All methods were less accurate at correctly classifying intermediate animals than extreme animals. Among the different alternatives proposed to analyze discrete traits, machine-learning showed some advantages over Bayesian regressions. Boosting with a pseudo Huber loss function showed high accuracy, whereas Random Forest produced more consistent results and an interesting predictive ability.
