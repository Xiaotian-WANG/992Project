5ee59518ddaef7cb84493569b8210454b76bd334,A flexible framework for sparse simultaneous component based data integration,"Abstract1 BackgroundHigh throughput data are complex and methods that reveal structure underlying the data are most useful. Principal component analysis, frequently implemented as a singular value decomposition, is a popular technique in this respect. Nowadays often the challenge is to reveal structure in several sources of information (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) that are available for the same biological entities under study. Simultaneous component methods are most promising in this respect. However, the interpretation of the principal and simultaneous components is often daunting because contributions of each of the biomolecules (transcripts, proteins) have to be taken into account.2 ResultsWe propose a sparse simultaneous component method that makes many of the parameters redundant by shrinking them to zero. It includes principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, and ordinary simultaneous component analysis as special cases. Several penalties can be tuned that account in different ways for the block structure present in the integrated data. This yields known sparse approaches as the lasso, the ridge penalty, the elastic net, the group lasso, sparse group lasso, and elitist lasso. In addition, the algorithmic results can be easily transposed to the context of regression. Metabolomics data obtained with two measurement platforms for the same set of Escherichia coli samples are used to illustrate the proposed methodology and the properties of different penalties with respect to sparseness across and within data blocks.3 ConclusionSparse simultaneous component analysis is a useful method for data integration: First, simultaneous analyses of multiple blocks offer advantages over sequential and separate analyses and second, interpretation of the results is highly facilitated by their sparseness. The approach offered is flexible and allows to take the block structure in different ways into account. As such, structures can be found that are exclusively tied to one data platform (group lasso approach) as well as structures that involve all data platforms (Elitist lasso approach).4 AvailabilityThe additional file contains a MATLAB implementation of the sparse simultaneous component method.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katrijn Van Deun"", ids = ""2799084""); list(name = ""Tom F.

In this paper, Chinese textbooks for grade 1 to 6 of primary schools published by Peopleâ€™s Education Press are taken as data sets, and the texts are divided into 12 difficulty levels successively. The effective lexical indexes to measure the readability of texts are discussed, and a regression model to effectively measure the lexical difficulty of Chinese texts is established. The study firstly collected 30 indexes at the text lexical level from the three dimensions of lexical richness, semantic transparency and contextual dependence, selected the 7 indexes with the highest relevance to the text difficulty through Person correlation coefficient, and finally constructed a Regression to predict the text difficulty based on Lasso Regression, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression and other algorithms. The regression results show that the model fits well, and the predicted value could explain 89.3% of the total variation of text difficulty, which proves that the quantitative index of vocabulary difficulty of Chinese text constructed in this paper is effective, and can be applied to Chinese grade reading and computer automatic grading of Chinese text difficulty.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hui Wang"", ids = ""39266955""); list(name = ""Lijiao Yang"", ids = ""1582727715""); list(name = ""Huimin Xiao"", ids = ""49802114"")",,,2019 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP),,480-486

Based on the re-weighted `2-penalization, the new method can simultaneously recover both the true sparsity and the inherent structures of the features, which makes it theoretically and practically appealing. The resulting estimate is shown to enjoy the oracle property. The proposed method also contains a set of variable selection or pattern estimation methods. As a special case, the fused broken adaptive ridge, which penalizes the differences between adjacent coefficients, is thoroughly discussed with applications in signal approximation and image processing. The associated algorithms are numerically easy to implement. Various simulation studies and real data analyses illustrate its advantages over the fused lasso method.",2018,,"list(name = ""Linlin Dai"", ids = ""37916676""); list(name = ""Kani Chen"", ids = ""2610426""); list(name = ""Gang Li"", ids = ""71300640"")",,ff238e62b0f07adb1c59efd08fd4d37d0aa37093; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 7604e059ba267d01837f9010a44f8910f08413b6; cc51c79f4172e8c7691475058dc50426bfb5d9fa; bb2ed891ade4ee8c9afdc802a7c3ed49f9e2a2c1; b1e99c01e2f1f5783d476b78c8d0503623f3891c; 88ff7c158c4fa072cbf0093ece0ac8a66069f9db; aa0a928ff2d304666f9a4d03586dcbdc3039dc61; 3766d6fe45328e3d94ea0b3823001a1e9d317214; cfcbcf4deebe56c3913548b4c5c7dc1061d1df96; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 6b5e99c128b9cd7b7fbc817a2843a47ce8a1c35d; 917c293120acede207162caf0a5bb3a056439b33; 5cb8a2fca7c62ecc08c9e8292e2d94f1b53c080c; d6f9318d82600c5c57b83df478f8f457726a9578; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; 5d72ad3c372ef741697382b75d0be5e91a73fa3b; 04f7769cf0908101af532b02428928baccb2c4d3; 4463f383a43b63c9f4bd9bf3b332f166ec79f3ec; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; a99eb8ba2c3187a00334168102253416271a0d55; e28ba0fd6ea94bd56f277d3a89de8f47fd5d1943; 533915d922c64903e4a4013a78ec03b91f522fc5; f8a59be88808d41d40dc8d2b4c600a83ab659e25; 54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; dbecb10bc0f6861883e14574b6e31b49b608ee3e; 30e7e25061b7ccd9a625548dd6836afcff85043b; 397851e47ac48d9838cb5643985df613d8f56051; 60e2fa3dcf9986dddf170f4d7cfa332f077c143e; 619518eddc515e3cf306cd66fe3866cbf9843fc7; c4a404eb202be07d3f5ca7ef544686ee2d831f35; 0886088b2ede707d7b3600112ed5e55504efe7f9; 544713f6b33af67edc6fd18e8087e6dceb34708c; 2522156b67603eac3066259585e136a653690eaf,,,

Advances in modern data collection technology have revolutionized the way that we study the complex biological systems, allowing pancreatic cancer researchers to make genome-wide expression profiling within tumors in a fast, precise, and cost-effective way. How to correctly analyze and interpret the high-dimensional and complex gene expression data is a key to understanding the hidden regulatory mechanisms. In this work, we first introduce a LASSO penalized Cox regression method to identify individual genes that are directly related to survival time of pancreatic cancer patients. A cyclic coordinate descent algorithm is used for the computation of high-dimensional data (number of genes larger than number of patients). Then, we introduce a doubly regularized Cox regression method, which integrates pathway information into our analysis, to identify both genes and signaling pathways related to pancreatic cancer survival. Both methods are applied to a pancreatic cancer microarray dataset and identify several genes and signaling pathways correlated to pancreatic cancer survival. Our findings can help cancer researchers design new strategies for the early detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Haijun Gong"", ids = ""1766427""); list(name = ""Tong Tong Wu"", ids = ""50375742""); list(name = ""Edmund M.

First we show that for an appropriately chosen sequence of step sizes, numerical derivative based delta methods provide consistent inference for functions of parameters that are directionally differentiable. Examples of directionally differentiable functions arise in a variety of economic applications such as moment inequalities models and threshold regression models. Second, we propose a numerical bootstrap method that provides asymptotically valid inference even for parameters that are not known to be directionally differentiable. The numerical bootstrap can consistently estimate the limiting distribution in many cases where the conventional bootstrap is known to fail and where subsampling has been the most commonly used inference approach. Applications include constrained and unconstrained M-estimators converging at both regular and nonstandard rates, misspecified simulated GMM models with nondifferentiable moments, LASSO, and 1-norm Support Vector Machine regression.",2016,,"list(name = ""Han Hong"", ids = ""145764126""); list(name = ""Jessie Li"", ids = ""47786078"")",217d3afdf47afcea3e09177f03a2d20281680658; ea121be16de899aec09efd3c764f697d70a284ad; 956bc66f0043962b8e057f57652f3cd336eeb72d; d9e8cae6689e957b9f2133eb4a780eb4c4c2d7c5; 7fc167dcd5bc0cb7f8c4f860a27afb8c76185c5d; c09af93058e070931b664af9a9cf45c09cc41282; 6d2d79dd37abcdc1eed64f374d326b218e5695a9; 2f602751f544a71914565a5c1e5237315cd41eaf; 59f7ba441ecb468a9dff1c17acd0b174b4965de7,3b51f2ec0c6f3290aaf70f22dd33eac479c80d3e; c23cf947279029e041fb743a4d1b5d7e1036e37c; 9a3c652893eaccaec83cd12bd7a3c972577edf8b; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; f6347d39ab2814da711d0fb71863add2520027a7; ae40bf62a17366d4c4c79f63d09d2707e2e5fc54; 4991ea3eb6e75191ef0b522119323ea0e64361d7; dd057a826d15bb60608930eea46841bf94f843ee; 243f5a4fd365ed5ed0513527204d80df21e8fcd5; a7bdc2bb562261eabc556c4b9047338eb3a77d5f; 0d0760fafa473700663edf6dc5e524ed49f51c69; ce8d43fec61a1d763d2a2f8f51779ae5614dee5c; e8b9a9da5c96b2ce4f2656f9de876abc711fffb3; 4d81a982911f1e0b31dbded3ee4e7631834b412b; 00e46e9b029121e1bc075b09fee7adae44d847e7; 92d0ccb10ea24a8e8aaefa6ee382fbd6133d5aa7; 625d103cc3610257af5cfa7e86135000a9be0e25; 41922c24434075fe180e1e3022031df8cb8cff3d; 9630044a0f4235e2f7cbe3a6f8c3d01cc879be9b; 0910c5dba9fc02ae9c2912e38a66e2648c63a17a; 8a7843d945037810aef104b9f5e8415e703bc45d; 3ff91f28967e0702667a644f8f9c53d964d63e4c; d6a0ecbb7853ce80ec895ebdd8b13a0aa14d8845; 7e4a93e893a3ff8e4ef44de9998bd27ab8d2b323; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 9415482c3bef23d0c7611f62b5581928d7a5b792; a8d6bb8c706ae8c05768d05aff1a8af5101d6fad; c74f3c797a2238d0a40fdce8dd201789bbc1242a; 1691f777a8866594fa722e172e694ac8d7113a90; fd3effb404e3b99d72091b6d86a81181dfb6a734; fe5675d35fd84688487074a9c62d41862a8968fd; 6e239689dc0f5f8e8777ce608f15d2e2e4a7418c; 4f27c088d767ddb8db4688f47c8458c53bcff2ff; 4fe4d75367ce14f2443aaea65a47eeb2c727e512; 4f4f5c203ddcd268f91dbd213a6162da3463d92d,,,

Evidence regarding the impact of regional body fat distribution on low-grade inflammation is limited. The current study examined the association of central and peripheral body fat distribution and low-grade inflammation levels in young adults, considering collinearity between variables.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A cross-sectional analysis of 809 adults (aged 27 years) was conducted as part of the EPITeen cohort, Porto, Portugal. Regional body fat was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured in a fasting blood sample. OLS (ordinary least squares) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression models were fitted to estimate the association of trunk and peripheral fat with hsCRP, stratified by sex. Using OLS regression, trunk fat in females was positively associated with ln(hsCRP) (Î²1Â =Â 0.064, 95% CI 0.018; 0.109). The effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown not to be significantly different from trunk fat (Î²2Â =Â -0.011, 95% CI -0.110; 0.089), but no statistically significant association was observed (Î²3Â =Â 0.053, 95% CI -0.004; 0.110) between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP). In males, trunk fat also showed a positive association with ln(hsCRP) (Î²1Â =Â 0.104, 95% CI 0.055; 0.154), and the effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown to be significantly different from trunk fat (Î²2Â =Â -0.124, 95% CI -0.237;-0.011). However, the association between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP) did not reach statistical significance (Î²3Â =Â -0.020, 95% CI -0.086; 0.046). The results of OLS were confirmed by LASSO regression.


CONCLUSION
A higher fat deposited in the trunk was positively associated with hsCRP, whereas no statistically significant effect was observed for peripheral fat.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Cabral"", ids = ""144546959""); list(name = ""Shrikant I.

People suffering from diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems. Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidney, etc. In addition, people with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing infections. This paper aims to use suitable data mining and classification techniques which include the Logit model, the Probit model, the Classification tree technique, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression technique and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in order to determine the best method which can be used to classify the patients as suffering from gestational diabetes or not.

Indeed, most well-known theoretical properties of the lasso, including recent advances in selective inference with the lasso, are established under the assumption that the underlying error variance is known. Yet the error variance in practice is, of course, unknown. In this paper, we propose the natural lasso estimator for the error variance, which maximizes a penalized likelihood objective. A key aspect of the natural lasso is that the likelihood is expressed in terms of the natural parameterization of the multiparameter exponential family of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance. The result is a remarkably simple estimator with provably good performance in terms of mean squared error. These theoretical results do not require placing any assumptions on the design matrix or the true regression coefficients. We also propose a companion estimator, called the organic lasso, which theoretically does not require tuning of the regularization parameter. Both estimators do well compared to preexisting methods, especially in settings where successful recovery of the true support of the coefficient vector is hard.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Guo Yu"", ids = ""143702522""); list(name = ""Jacob Bien"", ids = ""2154667"")",cf430e688023a1b50a6715cfbf30d8f582174a38; fbde04d43601abc0f696c6dd70ed1ef85b03ca26; e72a59076a28488d1c4359eaee8387f5d12eaf19,af3b83a260bc0de9b92b36e582f87810fcae3567; 89795e4859557b3cfa0ab6bd533428988bfd7ad0; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; f44a0c0015d8a28e42aea9b21f48fc2a30366def; b3d62cff3b1e4191307c2ad7b4dd3745aa4f88ed; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; f95f216e071b07b908014b4e8aef5b916d85d8c3; 4f0df00d0fa9f7d93d4c86dc21a6cc523addefd0; 0b1a19623aeb9fbac75e7bad01e701dc86a36b65; 3d95ae9504cfb904216be4f2bfda9315d0476986; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 19f90a8c59b2b5924debf81fc38c53f2f445b236; 07905a01bdb0efa20eb96d89efae1bd21b397685; 923212cffa329e43f5e0b0710724ddd880c67ef4; fc206fa6f7c7d2b8538bcd443f5ecb68717710aa; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; 53ae65cbc82e8343110c921490be98c7926129cf; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 1829b812d1c0ee6b6d02aaafe44c1fefaad4c7f9; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; e25f47c3f6b6620bd2df34df773da7d2cad99786; 93d617c2891e450ba8d5cd4149ba4fc38c962295; 5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; d82d35c96fb2aa5980b34a6312c7caf3b772ec7c; daab979a418f96409774b3a7241cff2cac4d1be2; 4f607f03272e4d62708f5b2441355f9e005cb452; ebec069fd2cc0ef61ac3d30491e30243bd89a631; 2540b36616761e6fde519eed00aef8f0e5e412a0; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 4950ed7975304748ed2f73522b72b777bf885fc7; b96c5bbdc6000949d4ed82c7dc23df3d4e19cd57,Biometrika,106,533-546
46973b92383991ca82b36abb18dc6af455526ab6,Data-adaptive additive modeling.,"In this paper, we consider fitting a flexible and interpretable additive regression model in a data-rich setting. We wish to avoid pre-specifying the functional form of the conditional association between each covariate and the response, while still retaining interpretability of the fitted functions. A number of recent proposals in the literature for nonparametric additive modeling are data adaptive, in the sense that they can adjust the level of flexibility in the functional fits to the data at hand. For instance, the sparse additive model makes it possible to adaptively determine which features should be included in the fitted model, the sparse partially linear additive model allows each feature in the fitted model to take either a linear or a nonlinear functional form, and the recent fused lasso additive model and additive trend filtering proposals allow the knots in each nonlinear function fit to be selected from the data. In this paper, we combine the strengths of each of these recent proposals into a single proposal that uses the data to determine which features to include in the model, whether to model each feature linearly or nonlinearly, and what form to use for the nonlinear functions. We establish connections between our approach and recent proposals from the literature, and we demonstrate its strengths in a simulation study.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ashley Petersen"", ids = ""34712871""); list(name = ""Daniela M.

cb252e37b05455444535abbf35c6d64557e88413,A new strategy of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator coupled with sampling error profile analysis for wavelength selection,"Abstract A new strategy based on sampling error profile analysis (SEPA) combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (SEPA-LASSO) was proposed. LASSO has been proven to be effective for multivariate calibration with automatic variable selection for high-dimensional data. However, in the previous research, the critical process of multivariate calibration by LASSO was an optimization of 1-norm turning parameter for a fixed sample set without considering the behaviors of variable selection by different subsets of samples. In the present work, Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS), the core of SEPA framework, is used to investigate various sub-models. Least angle regression (LAR) is used to solve LASSO, and various LAR iteration including certain number of variables could be obtained instead of choosing the numerical values of 1-norm turning parameters. SEPA-LASSO algorithm consists of plenty of loops. Under the SEPA framework and LAR algorithm, a number of LASSO sub-models with the same dimensions are built by MCS in each loop, the vote rule is used to determine the importance of variables and select them to build variable subsets. After running the loops, several subsets of variables are obtained and their error profile is used to choose the optimal subset of variables. The performance of SEPA-LASSO was evaluated by three near-infrared (NIR) datasets. The results show that the model built by SEPA-LASSO has excellent predictability and interpretability, compared with some commonly used multivariate calibration methods, such as principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), as well as some wavelength selection methods including LASSO, moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLSR), Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE), ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL) and stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS).",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ruoqiu Zhang"", ids = ""93380451""); list(name = ""Feiyu Zhang"", ids = ""3085024""); list(name = ""Wanchao Chen"", ids = ""12563879""); list(name = ""Heming Yao"", ids = ""3371985""); list(name = ""Jiong Ge"", ids = ""97416252""); list(name = ""Shengchao Wu"", ids = ""46238931""); list(name = ""Ting Wu"", ids = ""145333384""); list(name = ""Yiping Du"", ids = ""35338465"")",4b14c9ee45b8e10227998966fda3abc1dc36c1b6; 403c9073ffb56e1ac0e147f4bf1e87c7b2179331,,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems,175,47-54
3f5a9385fd56a1edeb2d365f0edf8930d09995f4,Single Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Heterogeneity of Human MSC Chondrogenesis: Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression to Identify Gene and Regulatory Signatures,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit the potential to undergo chondrogenesis in vitro, forming de novo tissues with a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that is rich in glycosaminoglycan and collagen type II. However, it is now apparent that MSCs comprise an inhomogeneous population of cells, and the fate of individual subpopulations during this differentiation process is not well understood. We analyzed the trajectory of MSC differentiation during chondrogenesis using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using a machine learning technique â€“ lasso regularized logistic regression â€“ we showed that multiple subpopulations of cells existed at all stages during MSC chondrogenesis and were better-defined by transcription factor activity rather than gene expression. Trajectory analysis indicated that subpopulations of MSCs were not intrinsically specified or restricted, but instead remained multipotent and could differentiate into three main cell types: cartilage, hypertrophic cartilage, and bone. Lasso regularized logistic regression showed several advances in scRNA-seq analysis, namely identification of a small number of highly influential genes or transcription factors for downstream validation, and cell type classification with high accuracy. Additionally, we showed that MSC differentiation trajectory may exhibit donor to donor variation, although key influential pathways were comparable between donors. Our data provide an important resource to study gene expression and to deconstruct gene regulatory networks in MSC differentiation.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Nguyen Pt Huynh"", ids = ""2405028""); list(name = ""Natalie H.

However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Xin Di"", ids = ""144276672""); list(name = ""Marie Wolfer"", ids = ""91223850""); list(name = ""Mario Amend"", ids = ""31933043""); list(name = ""Hans F.

cb943ab516fe14f19b6afbdbd42a5ccba1c6f06b,Shrinkage estimation for linear regression with ARMA errors,"Abstract In this paper, we extend the modified lasso of Wang et al. (2007) to the linear regression model with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) errors. Such an extension is far from trivial because new devices need to be called for to establish the asymptotics due to the existence of the moving average component. A shrinkage procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select the informative variables in the regression, autoregressive, and moving average components. We show that the resulting estimator is consistent in both parameter estimation and variable selection, and enjoys the oracle properties. To overcome the complexity in numerical computation caused by the existence of the moving average component, we propose a procedure based on a least squares approximation to implement estimation. The ordinary least squares formulation with the use of the modified lasso makes the computation very efficient. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the procedure.

385e5e185d4fb384845279ed7d6572b28137df2b,Robust Linear Regression Using L1-Penalized MM-Estimation for High Dimensional Data,"Large datasets, where the number of predictors p is larger than the sample sizes n, have become very popular in recent years. These datasets pose great challenges for building a linear good prediction model. In addition, when dataset contains a fraction of outliers and other contaminations, linear regression becomes a difficult problem. Therefore, we need methods that are sparse and robust at the same time. In this paper, we implemented the approach of MM estimation and proposed L1-Penalized MM-estimation (MM-Lasso).

4d5bb75fa6cae5980c77291ee36cc65259ed2f46,LASSO vector autoregression structures for very short-term wind power forecasting,"The deployment of smart grids and renewable energy dispatch centers motivates the development of forecasting techniques that take advantage of near real-time measurements collected from geographically distributed sensors. This paper describes a forecasting methodology that explores a set of different sparse structures for the vector autoregression (VAR) model using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) framework. The alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to fit the different VAR-LASSO variants and create a scalable forecasting method supported by parallel computing and fast convergence, which can be used by system operators and renewable power plant operators. A test case with 66 wind power plants is used to show the improvement in forecasting skill from exploring distributed sparse structures.

0ef12a6de63ff5c344a8c8ce4406c3fd97a5308f,Genetic risk factors identified in populations of European descent do not improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture and bone mineral density in Chinese populations,"Aiming to investigate whether genetic risk factors (GRFs) for fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) identified from people of European descent can help improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk and BMD in Chinese populations, we built assessment models for femoral neck (FN)-fracture prediction and BMD value prediction using 700 elderly Chinese Han subjects and 1,620 unrelated Chinese Han subjects, respectively. 17 fracture-associated genes and 82 FN-BMD associated genes identified in people of European descent were used to build a logistic regression model with clinical risk factors (CRFs) for FN-fracture prediction in Chinese. Meanwhile 107 BMD-associated genes from people of European descent were used to build a multiple linear regression model with CRFs for BMD prediction in Chinese. A Lasso algorithm was employed for informative SNP selection to construct the genetic risk score (GRS) with ten-fold cross-validation. The results showed that, adding fracture GRF and FN-BMD GRF to the model with CRFs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) decrease from 0.653 to 0.587 and 0.588, respectively, for FN fracture prediction. 62.3% and 61.8% of the risk variation were explained by the Model with CRFs and fracture GRF and by the Model with CRFs and FN-BMD GRF, respectively, as compared to 65.5% in the Model with CRFs only. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) index in the reclassification analysis is 0.56% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.57) and 1.13% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.29), respectively. There is no significant difference either between the performance of the model with CRFs and that of the model with both CRFs and GRF for BMD prediction. We concluded that, in the current study, GRF of fracture identified in people of European descent does not contributes to improve the fracture prediction in Chinese; and GRF of BMD from people of European descent cannot help improve the accuracy of the fracture prediction in Chinese perhaps partially because GRF of BMD from people of European descent may not contribute to BMD prediction in Chinese. This study highlights the limited utility of the current genetics studies largely focused on people of European descent for disease or risk factor prediction in other ethnic groups, and calls for more and larger scale studies focused on other ethnic groups.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yu-mei Li"", ids = ""50024943""); list(name = ""Cheng Peng"", ids = ""144211181""); list(name = ""Ji-Gang Zhang"", ids = ""8214718""); list(name = ""Wei Zhu"", ids = ""144700080""); list(name = ""Chao Xu"", ids = ""145194977""); list(name = ""Yong Lin"", ids = ""1753676""); list(name = ""Xiao-Ying Fu"", ids = ""48524245""); list(name = ""Qing Tian"", ids = ""144876832""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""50081469""); list(name = ""Yang Xiang"", ids = ""144024386""); list(name = ""Victor S.

97ff70978babf000854375ff941e4db817b90b91,"Predictors for Anastomotic Leak, Postoperative Complications, and Mortality After Right Colectomy for Cancer: Results From an International Snapshot Audit","Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. BACKGROUND: A right hemicolectomy is among the most commonly performed operations for colon cancer, but modern high-quality, multination data addressing the morbidity and mortality rates are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the morbidity and mortality rates for right-sided colon cancer and identifies predictors for unfavorable short-term outcome after right hemicolectomy. DESIGN: This was a snapshot observational prospective study. SETTING: The study was conducted as a multicenter international study. PATIENTS: The 2015 European Society of Coloproctology snapshot study was a prospective multicenter international series that included all patients undergoing elective or emergency right hemicolectomy or ileocecal resection over a 2-month period in early 2015. This is a subanalysis of the colon cancer cohort of patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors for anastomotic leak and 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed using multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression models after variables selection with the Lasso method. RESULTS: Of the 2515 included patients, an anastomosis was performed in 97.2% (n = 2444), handsewn in 38.5% (n = 940) and stapled in 61.5% (n = 1504) cases. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (180/2444), 30-day morbidity was 38.0% (n = 956), and mortality was 2.6% (n = 66). Patients with anastomotic leak had a significantly increased mortality rate (10.6% vs 1.6% no-leak patients; p > 0.001). At multivariable analysis the following variables were associated with anastomotic leak: longer duration of surgery (OR = 1.007 per min; p = 0.0037), open approach (OR = 1.9; p = 0.0037), and stapled anastomosis (OR = 1.5; p = 0.041). LIMITATIONS: This is an observational study, and therefore selection bias could be present. For this reason, a multivariable logistic regression model was performed, trying to correct possible confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Anastomotic leak after oncologic right hemicolectomy is a frequent complication, and it is associated with increased mortality. The key contributing surgical factors for anastomotic leak were anastomotic technique, surgical approach, and duration of surgery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B165. Predictores de Fuga AnastomÃ³tica, Complicaciones Postoperatorias y Mortalidad DespuÃ©s de la ColectomÃ­a Derecha por CÃ¡ncer: Resultados de Una AuditorÃ­a Internacional de Corto Plazo ANTECEDENTES: La hemicolectomÃ­a derecha se encuentra entre las operaciones mÃ¡s frecuentemente realizadas para cÃ¡ncer de colon, pero faltan datos modernos multinacionales de alta calidad, que aborden las tasas de morbilidad y mortalidad. OBJETIVO: Reportar la tasa de morbilidad y mortalidad para cÃ¡ncer de colon del lado derecho, e identificar predictores de resultados desfavorables a corto plazo, despuÃ©s de la hemicolectomÃ­a derecha. DISEÃ‘O: Estudio prospectivo observacional de corto plazo. LUGAR: Estudio multicÃ©ntrico internacional. PACIENTES: El estudio de corto plazo de la Sociedad Europea de ColoproctologÃ­a de 2015, fue una serie prospectiva multicÃ©ntrica internacional, que incluyÃ³ a todos los pacientes sometidos a hemicolectomÃ­a derecha electiva, de emergencia o resecciÃ³n ileocecal, por un perÃ­odo de dos meses y a principios de 2015. Este es un subanÃ¡lisis, cohorte de pacientes con cÃ¡ncer de colon. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO: Los predictores de fuga anastomÃ³tica, morbilidad y mortalidad postoperatorias a los 30 dÃ­as, se evaluaron usando modelos de regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica de efectos multivariables mixtos, despuÃ©s de la selecciÃ³n de variables con el mÃ©todo Lasso. RESULTADOS: De los 2,515 pacientes incluidos, se realizÃ³ una anastomosis en el 97,2% (n = 2,444); sutura manual en 38.5% (n = 940) y por engrapadora en 61.5% (n = 1504) casos. La tasa global de fuga anastomÃ³tica fue del 7,4% (180/2,444), morbilidad a los 30 dÃ­as fue del 38,0% (n = 956) y la mortalidad fue del 2,6% (n = 66). Los pacientes con fuga anastomÃ³tica tuvieron una tasa de mortalidad significativamente mayor (10,6% frente al 1,6% de pacientes sin fuga, p> 0,001). En el anÃ¡lisis multivariable, las siguientes variables se asociaron con la fuga anastomÃ³tica: mayor duraciÃ³n de la cirugÃ­a (OR 1.007 por minuto, p = 0.0037), abordaje abierto (OR 1.9, p = 0.0037) y anastomosis por engrapadora (OR 1.5, p = 0.041). LIMITACIONES: Este es un estudio observacional y por lo tanto podrÃ­a estar presente el sesgo de selecciÃ³n. Por esta razÃ³n, se realizÃ³ un modelo de regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica multivariable, tratando de corregir posibles factores de confusiÃ³n. CONCLUSIONES: La fuga anastomÃ³tica despuÃ©s de la hemicolectomÃ­a derecha oncolÃ³gica, es una complicaciÃ³n frecuente y asociada a mayor mortalidad. Los factores quirÃºrgicos clave que contribuyeron a la fuga anastomÃ³tica, fueron la tÃ©cnica anastomÃ³tica, abordaje quirÃºrgico y duraciÃ³n de la cirugÃ­a.

8d16011473e5be04bf9a0f725630f4831a4d4117,Suicide risk configuration system in a clustered clinical sample: a generalized linear model obtained through the LASSO technique,"OBJECTIVE
To identify clinical and sociodemographic factors that increase or decrease suicidal risk in a clinical sample of subjects seeking mental health care.


METHOD
A cross-sectional study was performed at three health centers in Santiago, Chile. The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), Depressive Experience Questionnaire (DEQ), Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL), and State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2), in addition to a sociodemographic survey, were applied to 544 participants (333 with suicidal behavior and 211 without current suicidal behavior). Through hierarchical clustering analysis, participants were grouped by similarity regarding suicidal risk. Then, a regression analysis was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique, and factors that decrease or increase suicide risk (SR) were identified for each cluster.


RESULTS
The resultant clusters were grouped mainly by the age of participants. The most important protective factor was having confidence in one's own coping skills in difficult situations. Relevant risk factors were major depressive disorder (MDD), poor anger management, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.

Suicidal risk manifests differently throughout the life cycle, and different types of bonds may protect from or increase risk of suicide.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""MarÃ­a de la Paz Maino"", ids = ""9035153""); list(name = ""Susana Morales"", ids = ""145731681""); list(name = ""Orietta EchÃ¡varri"", ids = ""7020749""); list(name = ""Jorge Barros"", ids = ""122582413""); list(name = ""Arnol GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""12934842""); list(name = ""Claudia Moya"", ids = ""103589719""); list(name = ""Tita Szmulewicz"", ids = ""9029042""); list(name = ""Ronit Fischman"", ids = ""31697928""); list(name = ""Catalina NÃºÃ±ez"", ids = ""9033730""); list(name = ""Alemka Tomicic"", ids = ""4252070"")",06a290d5292941278e089a1df371e60f7b7c1045,2f420d40bbef29f47005c1fc22c2aff98605f659; 9282e8328705830fd150a2ac0bc9116dfba9fff3; a1e432412dddca6cb604573d01a4aca7dcd11f70; d86f6e68a287aac7dcfab0cbdd1990eba6035c85; f82a64924dd12807014a66090aef7475ae5e0403; fa6729188520c7f1eb8a6309ef31625b7241f2ab; df04a7ef51d6d30cf4af54057bb51a9a7c337ebf; fb306a6521cf7ecd23ec3309b72dc4c28917087b; 1c3b10c8e6fe3b4c6a0e3b688baeff004bbb860b; 0cbc6722c26732afe58af8cf749d9c0d0ebe5832; fee4db01f6f981931dfd87376a8f861353d1e494; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 3112e7206ee5ca66ce8499392da8fa2f0cad016d; 47246b3268b9c647c0a6fdbeee0da3cdc7d3b78a; 33889980f6f8e05bf053eb0b5877ac35096aba2e; 45ca722cf0940592249430389050079a7aa607fc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria,41,112 - 121
1bcb155f4ef431fa18622692836ba51917bbe923,Regularized Least Squares Temporal Difference Learning with Nested â„“2 and â„“1 Penalization,"The construction of a suitable set of features to approximate value functions is a central problem in reinforcement learning (RL). A popular approach to this problem is to use high-dimensional feature spaces together with least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). Although this combination allows for very accurate approximations, it often exhibits poor prediction performance because of overfitting when the number of samples is small compared to the number of features in the approximation space. In the linear regression setting, regularization is commonly used to overcome this problem. In this paper, we review some regularized approaches to policy evaluation and we introduce a novel scheme (L 21 ) which uses l2 regularization in the projection operator and an l1 penalty in the fixed-point step. We show that such formulation reduces to a standard Lasso problem. As a result, any off-the-shelf solver can be used to compute its solution and standardization techniques can be applied to the data. We report experimental results showing that L 21 is effective in avoiding overfitting and that it compares favorably to existing l1 regularized methods.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Matthew W.

7b7ca38d6aa1b18e029100f7f1ca231a4434127c,PItcHPERFeCT: Primary Intracranial Hemorrhage Probability Estimation using Random Forests on CT,"INTRODUCTION
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where a blood vessel ruptures into areas of the brain, accounts for approximately 10-15% of all strokes. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning is largely used to assess the location and volume of these hemorrhages. Manual segmentation of the CT scan using planimetry by an expert reader is the gold standard for volume estimation, but is time-consuming and has within- and across-reader variability. We propose a fully automated segmentation approach using a random forest algorithm with features extracted from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans.


METHODS
The Minimally Invasive Surgery plus rt-PA in ICH Evacuation (MISTIE) trial was a multi-site Phase II clinical trial that tested the safety of hemorrhage removal using recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). For this analysis, we use 112 baseline CT scans from patients enrolled in the MISTE trial, one CT scan per patient. ICH was manually segmented on these CT scans by expert readers. We derived a set of imaging predictors from each scan. Using 10 randomly-selected scans, we used a first-pass voxel selection procedure based on quantiles of a set of predictors and then built 4 models estimating the voxel-level probability of ICH. The models used were: 1) logistic regression, 2) logistic regression with a penalty on the model parameters using LASSO, 3) a generalized additive model (GAM) and 4) a random forest classifier. The remaining 102 scans were used for model validation.For each validation scan, the model predicted the probability of ICH at each voxel. These voxel-level probabilities were then thresholded to produce binary segmentations of the hemorrhage. These masks were compared to the manual segmentations using the Dice Similarity Index (DSI) and the correlation of hemorrhage volume of between the two segmentations. We tested equality of median DSI using the Kruskal-Wallis test across the 4 models. We tested equality of the median DSI from sets of 2 models using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.


RESULTS
All results presented are for the 102 scans in the validation set. The median DSI for each model was: 0.89 (logistic), 0.885 (LASSO), 0.88 (GAM), and 0.899 (random forest). Using the random forest results in a slightly higher median DSI compared to the other models. After Bonferroni correction, the hypothesis of equality of median DSI was rejected only when comparing the random forest DSI to the DSI from the logistic (p < 0.001), LASSO (p < 0.001), or GAM (p < 0.001) models. In practical terms the difference between the random forest and the logistic regression is quite small. The correlation (95% CI) between the volume from manual segmentation and the predicted volume was 0.93 (0.9,0.95) for the random forest model. These results indicate that random forest approach can achieve accurate segmentation of ICH in a population of patients from a variety of imaging centers.

244d8901e9be28ef922f11a5341206b2056c54d2,Identification of a Nine-Gene Signature and Establishment of a Prognostic Nomogram Predicting Overall Survival of Pancreatic Cancer,"Background: Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and aggressive with increasing trend of mortality in both genders. An effective prediction model is needed to assess prognosis of patients for optimization of treatment. Materials and Methods: Seven datasets of mRNA expression and clinical data were obtained from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Level 3 mRNA expression and clinicopathological data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PAAD) dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor and normal tissue were identified by integrated analysis of multiple GEO datasets. Univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses were applied to identify overall survival-related DEGs and establish a prognostic gene signature whose performance was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. GSE62452 and GSE57495 were used for external validation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and tumor immunity analysis were applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and immune relevance. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer. Finally, a prognostic nomogram was established based on the TCGA PAAD dataset. Results: A nine-gene signature comprising MET, KLK10, COL17A1, CEP55, ANKRD22, ITGB6, ARNTL2, MCOLN3, and SLC25A45 was established to predict overall survival of pancreatic cancer. The ROC curve and C-index indicated good performance of the nine-gene signature at predicting overall survival in the TCGA dataset and external validation datasets relative to classic AJCC staging. The nine-gene signature could classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct overall survival and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. Univariate Cox regression revealed that the nine-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. The nomogram incorporating the gene signature and clinical prognostic factors was superior to AJCC staging in predicting overall survival.

75c4a4605fb94c3ae948dc28cf464423988a984d,"Sensory mapping, development and their applications to feature and attention selection","Rich literature has been generated on computer vision systems. However, an implementable computational model of immediate vision for general and unknown environments is still illusive. Motivated by the autonomous development process of humans, we are interested in building a robot vision system that automatically develops its visual cognitive skills through realtime interactions with the environment. Developmental vision is required by the demands of general-purpose vision systems for complex human environments. 
Based upon the above requirement, in this dissertation we propose a general architecture called Staggered Hierarchical Mapping (SHM) that performs feature derivation for a set of receptive fields and attention selection. The work reported here is motivated by the structure of the early visual pathway. We use several layers of staggered receptive fields to model the needed units of local analysis. From sequentially sensed video frames the proposed algorithm develops a hierarchy of filters, whose outputs are maximally uncorrelated within each layer, and contains an increasing scale of receptive fields that range from low to high layers. We also show how this general architecture can be applied to occluded face recognition, which demonstrates a case of attention selection. Besides this general neural network architecture, we develop several sensory mapping learning rules for deriving feature detectors, including a fast incremental independent component analysis (ICA) method called Lobe Component Analysis (LCA), which derives independent components for many natural cases. A mathematical analysis of the algorithm has been done and which shows the advantages of the LCA method. 
We push the research further by investigating the LCA method in a overcomplete setting, which means the number of basis functions is greater than dimension of the observation. A new incremental method is developed to solve the equivalent regression problem with sparse regulization term, i.e. the LASSO regression. We show that the LCA method is a special case when noise is not present. It makes LCA's principal applicable to a large variety of applications, e.g. classification, regression, and feature selection.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Juyang Weng"", ids = ""145926447""); list(name = ""Nan Zhang"", ids = ""144679550"")",,,,,
008917b49cb1631def8506320e1742573a81ec0f,"Urinary Magnesium and Other Elements in Relation to Mammographic Breast Density, a Measure of Breast Cancer Risk.","PURPOSE
Heavy metals and other elements may act as breast carcinogens due to estrogenic activity. We investigated associations between urine concentrations of a panel of elements and breast density.


METHODS
Mammographic density categories were abstracted from radiology reports of 725 women aged 40-65Â yr in the Avon Army of Women. A panel of 27 elements was quantified in urine using high resolution magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression to the 27 elements and calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dense vs. nondense breasts, adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Of the 27 elements, only magnesium (Mg) was selected into the optimal regression model. The odds ratio for dense breasts associated with doubling the Mg concentration was 1.24 (95% CI 1.03-1.49). Doubling the calcium-to-magnesium ratio was inversely associated with dense breasts (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98).


CONCLUSIONS
Our cross-sectional study found that higher levels of urinary magnesium were associated with greater breast density. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether magnesium as evaluated in urine is prospectively associated with breast density and, more importantly, breast cancer.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria C Mora-Pinzon"", ids = ""1403572965""); list(name = ""Amy Trentham-Dietz"", ids = ""1395659799""); list(name = ""Ronald E.
