d7810a1457708522cce7b3e423035f4722a00781,Stagewise generalized estimating equations with grouped variables.,"Forward stagewise estimation is a revived slow-brewing approach for model building that is particularly attractive in dealing with complex data structures for both its computational efficiency and its intrinsic connections with penalized estimation. Under the framework of generalized estimating equations, we study general stagewise estimation approaches that can handle clustered data and non-Gaussian/non-linear models in the presence of prior variable grouping structure. As the grouping structure is often not ideal in that even the important groups may contain irrelevant variables, the key is to simultaneously conduct group selection and within-group variable selection, that is, bi-level selection. We propose two approaches to address the challenge. The first is a bi-level stagewise estimating equations (BiSEE) approach, which is shown to correspond to the sparse group lasso penalized regression. The second is a hierarchical stagewise estimating equations (HiSEE) approach to handle more general hierarchical grouping structure, in which each stagewise estimation step itself is executed as a hierarchical selection process based on the grouping structure. Simulation studies show that BiSEE and HiSEE yield competitive model selection and predictive performance compared to existing approaches. We apply the proposed approaches to study the association between the suicide-related hospitalization rates of the 15-19 age group and the characteristics of the school districts in the State of Connecticut.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory Vaughan"", ids = ""50544805""); list(name = ""Robert Aseltine"", ids = ""145557946""); list(name = ""Kun Chen"", ids = ""145126975""); list(name = ""Jun Qi Yan"", ids = ""144361947"")",be33cc9e3e4416ec488bdf0454706a605982cb64; be9a75c1f417db890e3f19608705137d0352922f,c8430c5d13834e46631960469d86f7ed4577b0e2; 52101e21a438ddf01bcd1c21d15dcc96ebbd883a; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; 796add79b98dcfa7a5a23eb1ac12609b01421a25; 115cc0d668e54248d077db866de845c7bf23f1d4; 8bb843b4f274d77c60944e5ac7365a2f36d76c7d; 277c2139eb4e11455a0b16759b7249c3b95b479e; ed3a2b1d571a8188f41341f9b5c675a7682792b0; dd8139bd0afe49b169fb9352de97d62a73434b01; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; fe5a7fc0d49a34561c770726a565afa1eef4ae6f; 3a7cf84a18fb58bd6860e7d7b9b67aeef41edbbf; cf437cb4bde06c9e4865b16e616a2a261cc35984; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 574753071c85f6484f049305744d669c37c6a9d4; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 67f3c7d4c9b8df440e1f3f49f7d79d5ccd4d5d11; 6cd92ce3b6a45adcefe43c5dc49125146c0edb23; 5d72ad3c372ef741697382b75d0be5e91a73fa3b; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; b8ff13570f6f0d8b93c3d22cf2048d6f310a0a5e; 2f9d50dbbb050abb68881cbffd5348892e0c315b; 9389f400a83e39ae0b4493be7f272605056a1323; 9f96169ea4cbd294bc3dcf3ed590e1ce8d0747fd,Biometrics,73 4,"

7b71e44e249c1c40dbb92fdff0b255f0f8313851,TU-CD-BRB-01: Normal Lung CT Texture Features Improve Predictive Models for Radiation Pneumonitis,"Purpose: Existing normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for radiation pneumonitis (RP) traditionally rely on dosimetric and clinical data but are limited in terms of performance and generalizability. Extraction of pre-treatment image features provides a potential new category of data that can improve NTCP models for RP. We consider quantitative measures of total lung CT intensity and texture in a framework for prediction of RP. Methods: Available clinical and dosimetric data was collected for 198 NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. Intensity- and texture-based image features were extracted from the T50 phase of the 4D-CT acquired for treatment planning. A total of 3888 features (15 clinical, 175 dosimetric, and 3698 image features) were gathered and considered candidate predictors for modeling of RP gradeâ‰¥3. A baseline logistic regression model with mean lung dose (MLD) was first considered. Additionally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to the set of clinical and dosimetric features, and subsequently to the full set of clinical, dosimetric, and image features. Model performance was assessed by comparing area under the curve (AUC). Results: A simple logistic fit of MLD was an inadequate model of the data (AUCâˆ¼0.5). Including clinical and dosimetric parameters within the framework of the LASSO resulted in improved performance (AUC=0.648). Analysis of the full cohort of clinical, dosimetric, and image features provided further and significant improvement in model performance (AUC=0.727). Conclusions: To achieve significant gains in predictive modeling of RP, new categories of data should be considered in addition to clinical and dosimetric features. We have successfully incorporated CT image features into a framework for modeling RP and have demonstrated improved predictive performance. Validation and further investigation of CT image features in the context of RP NTCP modeling is warranted. This work was supported by the Rosalie B.

8b9e2b9fad8d666996fd8719925774fd1dab0080,The establishment and evaluation of a new model for the prediction of Children B-ALL based on TARGET: A SQUIRE-compliant study.,"B lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignant disease characterized by an accumulation of early B cells. This study aimed to construct a children B-ALL Nomogram prediction model based on Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments database, so as to further guide clinical diagnose and treatment.Clinical data related to children B-ALL were collected from the TARGET database, among which, the stage II clinical data were used as the prediction model, while the stage I clinical data were utilized as the external verification model. The stage II clinical factors were analyzed through Lasso regression analysis to screen the risk factors for the construction of Nomogram prediction model. In addition, the model prediction capacity and accuracy were verified internally and externally using the ROC curve, C-index and calibration curve, respectively.A total of 1316 B-ALL children were enrolled in this study. Lasso regression analysis revealed that, Age, Gender, WBC, CNSL, MRD29, BMR, CNS R, BCR-ABL1, BMA29, DS, and DI were the important prognostic risk factors. The C-index values of internal and external verification models were 0.870 and 0.827, respectively, revealing the ideal model discriminating capacity. Besides, the calibration curve had high contact ratio, which suggested favorable consistency between the incidence predicted by the model and the actual incidence. Moreover, the AUC values of the ROC curve were 0.858, 0.787, 0.898, and 0.867, respectively, indicating high model prediction accuracy in predicting the 3- and 5-year survival rates of children with B-ALL.The Nomogram prediction model plotted in this study exhibits favorable prediction capacity and clinical practicability for the survival rate of B-ALL children, which contributes to patients screening and clinical intervention.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiangyu Gao"", ids = ""1986323""); list(name = ""Wenjun Liu"", ids = ""48152037"")",,,Medicine,99 19,"

8b9a1b80460c5235b1e812b89cd650ba03a63d36,Instrumental Variable Estimation and Selection with Many Weak and Irrelevant Instruments,"This paper proposes a new two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator which is consistent and asymptotically normal in the presence of many weak and irrelevant instruments and heteroskedasticity. In the first stage the estimator uses an adaptive absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that selects the relevant instruments with high probability. However, the adaptive LASSO estimates have a considerable bias. To address this concern and exploit the instrument selection properties of the adaptive LASSO, an OLS regression with the selected instruments is performed in the first stage. The first stage can be constructed using the assumption of mean independence between the instruments and the structural random disturbance. This allows for the possibility of a nonparametric adaptive LASSO in the first stage. The second stage uses an OLS regression with the fitted values of the first stage. Simulation results suggest that the proposed methodology has better performance than the existing estimators when the levels of endogeneity and instrument weakness are high.",2012,,"list(name = ""Enrique Pinzon Garcia"", ids = ""122620220"")",ad5da8792e2c4a8892e777f96994d827c8fc2e26; 012c1bdf4ef40df7851342892c39107ce61fcd8e; 4de097166000f096cc41cd5d3793fc57e662f4d4,77a519a9b503b34c32cbd9a890312e98b65dc641; d4ff7059aead6b8771f2259bed1c9232d95d28dc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 7e1ce7efcb0fa493d19feb8333c76293410ce90f; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 32b1d2122fda31d393089dd15fbab743c5e9a960; 2223ef9dcb794ade83e3bb5108ad7b6a9b8195b9; 619518eddc515e3cf306cd66fe3866cbf9843fc7; 9e69d6df41cecc599b12dada327a80529e283d2a; 01e1de92eeb8103654e939d0290bbf233e7ea003; 85dfc357c4852c7f441a42422d2bc14991722515; da290f68fd680fab0d1837b305967673cbc35e53; f5e5018a59bfd8170cbf1e359681c3cd89bb9c4b; ee0773dfb022e61e21670c41a05510f32336f424; 144f635caee0f45203a4eaf9a0b68ff52ca9f610; 7733d1213c533c05cd77f2e9fe5c7410f6085f95; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; cb320dcef14ba6152177346dd346bd908272b78f; 8b92f95c6d7b1e7724badd51c851e1a34af36764,,,

To analyze the effect of clinical and dosimetric factors on TLN.Patients and methodsIn this study the prediction model was developed in a training cohort that consisted of 256 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients from January 2009 to December 2009. Dosimetric and clinical factors were extracted for model building. Dosimetric factors including the maximum dose, minimum dose, mean dose, dose covering specific volume and dose of percentage volume. Clinical factors include age, gender, T/N-stage, overall stage, diabetes and hypertension. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression model was used for feature selection, and prediction model building. A testing cohort containing 493 consecutive patients from January 2010 to December 2010 was used for model validation. The performance of the prediction model was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination.ResultsThe prediction model, which consisted of two dosimetric features (D0.5cc and D10), is significantly associated with LN status (PÂ <â€‰.001 for both training and testing cohorts). None of clinical factors show direct prediction value. The model shows good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.685 (95% CI: 0.6048â€“0.765) on testing set, and a consistent trend in calibration on testing set.ConclusionThis study presents a prediction model can be conveniently used to facilitate the individualized prediction of TLN in patients with NPC.

To evaluate selection methods among published single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA to construct predictive genetic risk scores (GRSs) in a population-based setting.


METHODS
The Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health (HUNT) Study is a prospective cohort study among the whole adult population of northern TrÃ¸ndelag, Norway. Participants in HUNT2 (1995-1997) and HUNT3 (2006-2008) were included (489 RA cases, 61Â 584 controls). The initial SNP selection from relevant genome-wide studies included 269 SNPs from 30 studies. Following different selection criteria, SNPs were weighted by published odds ratios. The sum of each person's carriage of all weighted susceptibility variants was calculated for each GRS.


RESULTS
The best-fitting risk score included 27 SNPs [weighted genetic risk score 27 (wGRS27)] and was identified using P-value selection criterion â‰¤5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8, the largest possible SNP selection without high linkage disequilibrium (r2â€‰<â€‰0.8), and lasso regression to select for positive coefficients. In a logistic regression model adjusted for gender, age and ever smoking, wGRS27 was associated with RA [odds ratio 1.86 (95% CI 1.71, 2.04) for each s.d. increase, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001]. The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.74, 0.78). The positive and negative predictive values were 1.6% and 99.7%, respectively, and the positive predictive value was not improved in sensitivity analyses subselecting participants to illustrate settings with increased RA prevalences. Other schemes selected more SNPs but resulted in GRSs with lower predictive ability.


CONCLUSION
Constructing a wGRS based on a smaller selection of informative SNPs improved predictive ability. Even with a relatively high AUC, the low PPV illustrates that there was a large overlap in risk variants among RA patients and controls, precluding clinical usefulness.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sodabeh Rostami"", ids = ""13042058""); list(name = ""M.

To evaluate whether if ultrasonography (US)-based radiomics enables prediction of the presence of BRAFV600E mutations among patients diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcninoma (PTC).


METHODS
From December 2015 to May 2017, 527 patients who had been treated surgically for PTC were included (training: 387, validation: 140). All patients had BRAFV600E mutation analysis performed on surgical specimen. Feature extraction was performed using preoperative US images of the 527 patients (mean size of PTC: 16.4mmÂ±7.9, range, 10-85 mm). A Radiomics Score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Univariable/multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors including Radiomics Score in predicting BRAFV600E mutation. Subgroup analysis including conventional PTC <20-mm (n = 389) was performed (training: 280, validation: 109).


RESULTS
Of the 527 patients diagnosed with PTC, 428 (81.2%) were positive and 99 (18.8%) were negative for BRAFV600E mutation. In both total 527 cancers and 389 conventional PTC<20-mm, Radiomics Score was the single factor showing significant association to the presence of BRAFV600E mutation on multivariable analysis (all P<0.05). C-statistics for the validation set in the total cancers and the conventional PTCs<20-mm were lower than that of the training set: 0.629 (95% CI: 0.516-0.742) to 0.718 (95% CI: 0.650-0.786), and 0.567 (95% CI: 0.434-0.699) to 0.729 (95% CI: 0.632-0.826), respectively.

81a39854d4a765c3ec09f4f9f5be9b6ea5dcfb2d,Extraction of Urban Waterlogging Depth from Video Images Using Transfer Learning,"Urban flood control requires real-time and spatially detailed information regarding the waterlogging depth over large areas, but such information cannot be effectively obtained by the existing methods. Video supervision equipment, which is readily available in most cities, can record urban waterlogging processes in video form. These video data could be a valuable data source for waterlogging depth extraction. The present paper is aimed at demonstrating a new approach to extract urban waterlogging depths from video images based on transfer learning and lasso regression. First, a transfer learning model is used to extract feature vectors from a video image set of urban waterlogging.

1bded8a47be8f6e75c6b7416d931713d32937cf8,Virtual metrology of semiconductor PVD process based on combination of tree-based ensemble model.,"In order to improve the accuracy of semiconductor wafer virtual metrology, and overcome the physical metrology delay of wafer acceptance test, a virtual physical vapor deposition metrology method based on combination of tree-based ensemble models is proposed to conduct online virtual metrology on semiconductor wafer electrical parameters, and use hyperparameter optimization technique to perform model optimization and to achieve real-time alarm on process deviation. This combination of tree-based ensemble model combines Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking techniques. First, based on 4 types of base learner, Random Forest, Extra-Trees, XGBoost, and lightGBM, preliminary virtual metrology is performed on wafer PVD process, and then transforms the predict results of the 4 base learners into meta feature vector as the input of meta learner lightGBM to perform further virtual metrology. The Sequential model-based optimization algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of virtual metrology. First, the initial hyperparameter of the sequential model-based optimization is initialized by using random sampling, then the combination model is approximated by the surrogate model of tree-structured Parzen estimator, and the recommended hyperparameters is obtained by using EI (Expected Improvement), and then the optimized combination model is obtained. Finally, the superiority of the method proposed in this paper is verified by studying the results comparing to the common virtual metrology methods on the PVD process. The experiment shows the result of resistivity metrology using the combination of tree-based ensemble models in the PVD process is significantly better than LASSO regression, partial least squares regression(PLSR), support vector machine(SVR), Gaussian process regression(GPR) and artificial neural network regression(ANN).",2020,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ching-Hsien Chen"", ids = ""48240315""); list(name = ""Weidong Zhao"", ids = ""103367443""); list(name = ""Timothy Pang"", ids = ""1627810729""); list(name = ""Yizheng.

d6d04dca1fbf799e27a89be1acb4efe1142cfb92,Variable selection in monotone single-index models via the adaptive LASSO.,"We consider the problem of variable selection for monotone single-index models. A single-index model assumes that the expectation of the outcome is an unknown function of a linear combination of covariates. Assuming monotonicity of the unknown function is often reasonable and allows for more straightforward inference. We present an adaptive LASSO penalized least squares approach to estimating the index parameter and the unknown function in these models for continuous outcome. Monotone function estimates are achieved using the pooled adjacent violators algorithm, followed by kernel regression. In the iterative estimation process, a linear approximation to the unknown function is used, therefore reducing the situation to that of linear regression and allowing for the use of standard LASSO algorithms, such as coordinate descent. Results of a simulation study indicate that the proposed methods perform well under a variety of circumstances and that an assumption of monotonicity, when appropriate, noticeably improves performance. The proposed methods are applied to data from a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of a critical illness in the intensive care unit.",2013,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jared C Foster"", ids = ""35200486""); list(name = ""Jeremy m.

687dc216769b4d1afdf9d725a268995f699f84fa,Dependent relevance determination for smooth and structured sparse regression,"In many problem settings, parameter vectors are not merely sparse, but dependent in such a way that non-zero coefficients tend to cluster together. We refer to this form of dependency as ""region sparsity"". Classical sparse regression methods, such as the lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD), which model parameters as independent a priori, and therefore do not exploit such dependencies. Here we introduce a hierarchical model for smooth, region-sparse weight vectors and tensors in a linear regression setting. Our approach represents a hierarchical extension of the relevance determination framework, where we add a transformed Gaussian process to model the dependencies between the prior variances of regression weights. We combine this with a structured model of the prior variances of Fourier coefficients, which eliminates unnecessary high frequencies. The resulting prior encourages weights to be region-sparse in two different bases simultaneously. We develop Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to provide efficient inference for the posterior. Furthermore, a two-stage convex relaxation of the Laplace approximation approach is also provided to relax the inevitable non-convexity during the optimization. We finally show substantial improvements over comparable methods for both simulated and real datasets from brain imaging.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Anqi Wu"", ids = ""33515312""); list(name = ""Oluwasanmi Koyejo"", ids = ""143812875""); list(name = ""Jonathan W.

0be196a2129cbc37ffe9750764ff955d71e44947,"More powerful post-selection inference, with application to the Lasso","Investigators often use the data to generate interesting hypotheses and then perform inference for the generated hypotheses. P-values and confidence intervals must account for this explorative data analysis. A fruitful method for doing so is to condition any inferences on the components of the data used to generate the hypotheses, thus preventing information in those components from being used again. Some currently popular methods ""over-condition"", leading to wide intervals. We show how to perform the minimal conditioning in a computationally tractable way. In high dimensions, even this minimal conditioning can lead to intervals that are too wide to be useful, suggesting that up to now the cost of hypothesis generation has been underestimated. We show how to generate hypotheses in a strategic manner that sharply reduces the cost of data exploration and results in useful confidence intervals. Our discussion focuses on the problem of post-selection inference after fitting a lasso regression model, but we also outline its extension to a much more general setting.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Keli Liu"", ids = ""6863863""); list(name = ""Jelena Markovic"", ids = ""1949957""); list(name = ""Robert Tibshirani"", ids = ""1761784"")",fc6434e53264a1f05ec5fe08a9172078eedbbe29; b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2; a525af4361684de8067cdd378315f21297486150; 1a9fcdb5b9b84f24ac2f6fb8cd5b4511f4c6ec56; c04a7540cc5c5f648b0e1e0c02fe4538d8df3b6d; 255266eca3f2611e1e702d425e24d3d0dc8c6481; 9985c0647214dacf3c1443b20d285f4a4f127e5c; f27edb982c6362778f02497666a6e5b2604d9c43; 6d88f80cd6bc5195007e1c6b894e6aa11fa8bdab; 8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42; e4b22e20ffc39661c166cb599d786652792aa805,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; a3fe2fb7ccb0c427a25fec8159996c674e299c68; 3ba6d46203af2f81f6414a940fdff38e3a6dc32b; 13594c3d461984009c5464179b89637bb691e964; 96c98cc1351265d2b36f63e32472a34ff38c41fc; daab979a418f96409774b3a7241cff2cac4d1be2; 0f74aac5679b330d68a5da31e607092ae895a23d; 79e8b756f8cc59b4b5aaf1a7de7094f3a935803e; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; 7adbaea0b1987e3f4b8e39929f7057e1f03560d5; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 1829b812d1c0ee6b6d02aaafe44c1fefaad4c7f9; 307d4f561831d98246c91424b84ff90f81b964eb; a56b8c46cbc273ba566c16e14e86130e9b194c86,arXiv: Methodology,,
8b6520aebae262dfa14ab3a8de2d7de1e2556aff,Comparing Approaches to Treatment Effect Estimation for Subgroups in Early Phase Clinical Trials,"Identifying subgroups, which respond differently to a treatment, both in terms of efficacy and safety, is an important part of drug development. In early phase exploratory clinical trials the well-known challenges of subgroup analyses are further amplified by the low sample size and because relatively limited clinical prior information on the drug is available. We evaluate some novel strategies for subgroup identification and treatment effect estimation in these settings in a simulation study motivated by real clinical trial situations. We compare several approaches to estimate treatment effects for selected subgroups, employing model averaging, resampling and lasso regression methods. For subgroup identification two approaches are compared, one based on categorization of covariates and the other based on splines. Our results show that naive estimation of the treatment effect, which ignores that a selection has taken place, leads to bias and overoptimistic conclusions. For the considered simulation scenarios virtually all evaluated novel methods provide more adequate estimates of the treatment effect for selected subgroups, in terms of bias, MSE and confidence interval coverage.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marius Thomas"", ids = ""35303030""); list(name = ""BjÃ¶rn Bornkamp"", ids = ""2912259"")",825387012b2f7849b0a3cb0cbcf86e967e16114a; 6942e16f4ca0eb0a538539ad746d846dfbf63df3; 22d3add51380eabdb9482fa084df8564adce9de2,,arXiv: Computation,,
c84f99aeafe445d997b578be08e5027c43c5ec62,Network-Based Inference Framework for Identifying Cancer Genes from Gene Expression Data,"Great efforts have been devoted to alleviate uncertainty of detected cancer genes as accurate identification of oncogenes is of tremendous significance and helps unravel the biological behavior of tumors. In this paper, we present a differential network-based framework to detect biologically meaningful cancer-related genes. Firstly, a gene regulatory network construction algorithm is proposed, in which a boosting regression based on likelihood score and informative prior is employed for improving accuracy of identification. Secondly, with the algorithm, two gene regulatory networks are constructed from case and control samples independently. Thirdly, by subtracting the two networks, a differential-network model is obtained and then used to rank differentially expressed hub genes for identification of cancer biomarkers. Compared with two existing gene-based methods (t-test and lasso), the method has a significant improvement in accuracy both on synthetic datasets and two real breast cancer datasets. Furthermore, identified six genes (TSPYL5, CD55, CCNE2, DCK, BBC3, and MUC1) susceptible to breast cancer were verified through the literature mining, GO analysis, and pathway functional enrichment analysis. Among these oncogenes, TSPYL5 and CCNE2 have been already known as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer, CD55 has been suspected of playing an important role in breast cancer prognosis from literature evidence, and other three genes are newly discovered breast cancer biomarkers. More generally, the differential-network schema can be extended to other complex diseases for detection of disease associated-genes.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Yang"", ids = ""145628398""); list(name = ""Junying Zhang"", ids = ""47539446""); list(name = ""Yaling Yin"", ids = ""6139917""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Zhang"", ids = ""2364163"")",c7c97dc09950f904e4c7b4d5745be2ac323adca8; 142326a06d43ee8c21d9e213e2aeb0f839579e04; df1e8ad4d1c4e6d896ac8ce38bc77fab9a306f40; a9bbe891b2c2e2189d7babcebec9f6fe121e0235; 68418cd52cb8d635c14ac401f584b36ecb78764d; 971b671d06ad1aba137e51757846f076f7bf01e3; 0878bb52c44924fe8b0b456b1ca3e170247b8d33; c03bcab2a3559b98a8b39ae64c2b338e9e5d1f3c; 359662a7e8a9fba2e36e40fae5d6624f9ea4afed; 4c2b02fb67bbe61a95e7bb53f2018739355820c0; 784f9e53df396771daadb567f8de2423a2fc7c40; 0746da5e8ae6a5099b1bcdfe5dbaddb04ec5e68c,1bb43e9a281a921eb6c061d4e6d6fe62600a0a3e; 4dca10776e77af12ba2c8a332ff152d04f025089; 54c3151cbc2382a2fd5518e77d45cd7a1a1f182f; b6f1c2fdd994d35513c5e41468faf994218eb44c; a94e96f375f670490c691972f17cb9b6d671e397; e780749c7ef5d80a608858480b855d6b5b6b17a1; d32b38750ef2b33af20eca5108e9b2567874df3c; 81f9b282e7898e3d50a4827333d9c830e318c52a; 4cdda994eb54b7591da9e1b2dcda661502056451; 58d9e780b459f0336f15ac28a8c6c68ec158b349; d2e50eab2cbc58ce81b4d43cf21e690e84e78f74; c0c724b4abbb17fb6d9061bb2febfe611f6a88cc; 8e6e6c384a15abb26fb2973ab76a584d991ac3e7; 6b5e99c128b9cd7b7fbc817a2843a47ce8a1c35d; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 0c951f9e5232697cfe4449bb4d0063607df362e2; 2fe2084087a3589ff1b7724649aa2972ae97f545; 69d33e8415399f7db1a0481783d41b854804d018; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222; c7cb4ab6226ffb5220ae1d9d6ab7552d7bea2e0a; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 3eb58a9b1f7796f383edd423ada256cd74043edb; ecfcb613fc7d2108c246c1815eab663e046f2a59; d28055d0558fc4be9de0a26cc63fe583dc82aab3; 0f404bd9f198b414a67ee820b627f113e1fd5e75; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 315f72e8889dd6784938d81d13a0486f7d1dc1b9; 0e6aefc52cc98104fdd802cd4fa9878d9f5fbca5; 022711984924225ce080d3e12db79c6530f4c3f0; 88d01049b49f08c57b2b99e3abd4bb6634e58ad8; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 52c9079a7bcb95f2dcc7a5107286da9bed9b1599; 113d344094fd831ca5c7adfc76c0b44bb3493c5b; aac6a3c93e38044e6084abc96a7939a7b2e11718; 5ef8284be6094d4b60571fcddbce76d3b7292623; 66a3388a1d988e7595448e0f0641f6cb568b6d6f; 7ec9d6ca864c9792cf033433b28be5c5742c42c5; 8e80fdd73ef7dc740b9857c1893514400bca7aad,BioMed Research International,2013,
647ee5b088a3f182403b96d428fb24f044f9e812,Graphon estimation via nearest neighbor algorithm and 2D fused lasso denoising,"We propose a class of methods for graphon estimation based on exploiting connections with nonparametric regression. The idea is to construct an ordering of the nodes in the network, similar in spirit to Chan and Airoldi (2014). However, rather than only considering orderings based on the empirical degree as in Chan and Airoldi (2014), we use the nearest neighbor algorithm which is an approximating solution to the traveling salesman problem. This in turn can handle general distances $\hat{d}$ between the nodes, something that allows us to incorporate rich information of the network. Once an ordering is constructed, we formulate a 2D grid graph denoising problem that we solve through fused lasso regularization. For particular choices of the metric $\hat{d}$, we show that the corresponding two-step estimator can attain competitive rates when the true model is the stochastic block model, and when the underlying graphon is piecewise H\""{o}lder or it has bounded variation.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla"", ids = ""2527891"")",86edc96ce4faa5bd685bc375c7f5ca49f50459ef,e655546e7133b5c97647da066a90b112fe3c9aeb; 7ae148184061f3c88e8b9b2f630f12624a19064e; 5a90c2dd3ae1c51516e3ec0e4c50113395d98518; a5cf0aaa2aa5fd60427dca622172b7c9cdb40358; af81cabbdd1a16c0380da89b8a2f4ce1e41a4d8c; a0af629b709f8044f54ed7d42b099968ff16b7c5; 033bc71d543f8a530cc1610da87f8633552cf3e9; 0c2cb75ef6520162f5b0f00955aaf2a3eefcfe97; 590e2404cd62c018fb3aeba36f30b3be5a9171e6; 0be1a61e2a595a2558229c3de8d9c39ece224fa5; b74eb1b46df6e1ba11c865f80e1b8882a7abf097; 207516c9820ed03bc6e71265cca8e9a69368a9f6; ae011182435a9bb11afedefd8214bcf355f7103c; b1ce2c495ca94310a41dc432fa4dc7b907a1a2f4; 7f3ad695ac38e4b248eba2eb664f73bf2be825a2; 0c9a37c546efaee637b8ce510dd748860a472026; 12d8220e097c4881cbca323885aaf5520747e3b9; c93e2d1d79f6dfbccec8efcd915ddfb499ce2faa; bb952cb9066d40d1c87721e778adbd08074bce30; 7120779b4df86db4c6019b2c81c8c4f988aa94ea; d3201762486b88bbd6fa7a8c62a96ea69f76923f; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; 533915d922c64903e4a4013a78ec03b91f522fc5; 54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9; 2d03b2d4cbd2c483a46c0c39b5fecdf407319eec; ed796d7626d70749afb0bf713429198f74c8f3df; a9fbb9a2cbc71f93b08f8bcbd506255446b47d66; 475653e1eceaf104ef431f061d33d70ab9906be9; c66db9b93d75c0ff52e7f84605b8389345307006; 9032eba416e554ee68571112ebaf50171949625c; b0f94065320d9f648babd122db0807dd4ffd181b; 00ae21c9a84bc24f35448acddcf4fd30539604a0; ea125641a4d2ebd91d2173d0f0cb7bc7f744d354; 4443a96f79cfbd5bc4170f84db4fd6f7df6edaab,arXiv: Methodology,,

From this viewpoint, we first revisited the problem of recognizing faces across pose differences, which is a bottleneck in face recognition. Then, we propose a new approach for cross-pose face recognition using a regressor with a coupled bias-variance tradeoff. We found that striking a coupled balance between bias and variance in regression for different poses could improve the regressor-based cross-pose face representation, i.e., the regressor can be more stable against a pose difference. With the basic idea, ridge regression and lasso regression are explored. Experimental results on CMU PIE, the FERET, and the Multi-PIE face databases show that the proposed bias-variance tradeoff can achieve considerable reinforcement in recognition performance.",2012,Computer Science;

While, the LARC patients might relieve to T1N0M0/T0N0M0 stage after the CRT, which would enable the patients be qualified for local excision. However, accurate pathological TNM stage could only be obtained by the pathological examination after surgery. We aimed to conduct a Radiomics analysis of Diffusion weighted Imaging (DWI) data to identify the patients in T1N0M0/T0N0M0 stages before surgery, in hope of providing clinical surgery decision support. 223 routinely treated LARC patients in Beijing Cancer Hospital were enrolled in current study. DWI data and clinical characteristics were collected after CRT. According to the pathological TNM stage, the patients of T1N0M0 and T0N0M0 stages were labelled as 1 and the other patients were labelled as 0. The first 123 patients in chronological order were used as training set, and the rest patients as validation set. 563 image features extracted from the DWI data and clinical characteristics were used as features. Two-sample T test was conducted to pre-select the top 50% discriminating features. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)-Logistic regression model was conducted to further select features and construct the classification model. Based on the 14 selected image features, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.8781, classification Accuracy (ACC) of 0.8432 were achieved in the training set. In the validation set, AUC of 0.8707, ACC (ACC) of 0.84 were observed.",2018,Engineering; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhenchao Tang"", ids = ""3447227""); list(name = ""Zhenyu Liu"", ids = ""143699466""); list(name = ""Xiaoyan Zhang"", ids = ""1680791""); list(name = ""Yanjie Shi"", ids = ""2099845""); list(name = ""Shou Wang"", ids = ""40773970""); list(name = ""Mengjie Fang"", ids = ""144466185""); list(name = ""Yingshi Sun"", ids = ""143971682""); list(name = ""Enqing Dong"", ids = ""1739780""); list(name = ""Jie Tian"", ids = ""145883431"")",,b89e80d166c3ec3cf55bb4bc7dfd4fb328f66053; 95616b900391eb7d330ae4d323238f439220589f; 93c741d8de90ac4613376c3bdb47d57ddf4322af; f13a12c56f2b471bc1b5724576431ead09e8dcdf; 52f0ae083900369fc6a200da3a0180db178535fe; 5fc88f482d28f7c8c2b12d9ac103006b34e614d0; a45cfa39a550a974b13046e882697bf415dbe916; 934a2055975c7953d3587acd2d91827660d8a180; 6961996852c7116bde9ea153c295f06003a0df18; 5b03d8379ff3df5912306cd4ef1a9b9dddafe0d1,,10575,
6dd95bdb53d09a3da9be345cc1bd26ead16f5bd7,A visual survey of the inshore fish communities of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands).,"An in situ visual survey technique (5 minutes and 100 m area) was used to assess the inshore fishes off Gran Canaria. In 1996, 211 visual surveys were conducted at 7 localities. Locations differed significantly among each other with regards to the number of species per survey (ANOVA: p < 0.01). The five most abundant species were Chromis limbatus, Boops boops, Pomadasys incisus, Abudefduf luridus, and Thalassoma pavo with respective mean abundances of 65.6, 37.4, 16.7, 8.7, and 4.5 per 100 m. Detrended Correspondence Analysis, a multivariate ordination technique showed that the major determinant of community structure is substrate type. The majority of the surveyed species had low axis 1 ordination scores indicating a strong association with a hard substrate. The step-wise linear regression models explained 45.3 % and 1 1.4% of the variation in the first and second axis survey ordination scores, respectively.",2001,Geography,"list(name = ""Janos Hajagos"", ids = ""71575113""); list(name = ""James Van Tassel"", ids = ""66072475"")",363c37d3399c2c6841c2ab849e99fcb8631d6fcb; 5d2dc66ccdb5a3149e32a4f8c8d8a0441e132915; c26befd86d0f1680e7764cceaa2982d02d2573c2; e19a5725ec4cf1268343ef74289775ab817bfe10,1c26083af7b1457af0c34e90e708fe5e32c8d207; 94a1911856e092c649f9178f541a878cd060d6e6; 9a3a90a7c43f5c8fe5d68e9aa8e409a1d44896d9; 5935f5884dc378c6fc5e4b69d68e2aa3ae082957; 613ca6db1da051fc4c547fadb2ce93f03b90a169; cf73efae695e84dc6912e4475a3e99d7fdaea038; 66f84f8325d57ebda40bcbaab0f1712ae1362e90; 30c5e1138804b0b1226cef10a0bcf003f88fbc4c; 6313e597fe070263fae7017126a813e8d957f660; 468c9acc9761eb62082e8c86f96ac62008b950c5; 8a08ef5b449c6b5ac916d59c541a719bc0a7724f; be04e1042d91a2540aa07050c089c3e64530dc46; 7b68631b1413f50fe16c0d71fa21882af9c2a407; 56a29d196f61e602dec3f5d0a6610cc15f17907e; 4510d23446293595d2f46d309b3b2cb5198259d6,,,
b800f9dde3ee805463172f38db62b79b2a8ce98a,Variable Selection for Cox's proportional Hazards Model and Frailty Model,"A class of variable selection procedures for parametric models via nonconcave penalized likelihood was proposed in Fan and Li (2001a). It has been shown there that the resulting procedures perform as well as if the subset of significant variables were known in advance. Such a property is called an oracle property. The proposed procedures were illustrated in the context of linear regression, robust linear regression and generalized linear models. In this paper, the nonconcave penalized likelihood approach is extended further to the Cox proportional hazards model and the Cox proportional hazards frailty model, two commonly used semi-parametric models in survival analysis. As a result, new variable selection procedures for these two commonly-used models are proposed. It is demonstrated how the rates of convergence depend on the regularization parameter in the penalty function. Further, with a proper choice of the regularization parameter and the penalty function, the proposed estimators possess an oracle property. Standard error formulae are derived and their accuracies are empirically tested. Simulation studies show that the proposed procedures are more stable in prediction and more effective in computation than the best subset variable selection, and they reduce model complexity as effectively as the best subset variable selection. Compared with the LASSO, which is the penalized likelihood method with the L 1 -penalty, proposed by Tibshirani, the newly proposed approaches have better theoretic properties and finite sample performance.",2002,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jianqing Fan"", ids = ""144958605"");

3390cf302fae03e12a6ba53376156d2083dc9b89,Distributed soft thresholding for sparse signal recovery,"In this paper, we address the problem of distributed sparse recovery of signals acquired via compressed measurements in a sensor network. We propose a new class of distributed algorithms to solve Lasso regression problems, when the communication to a fusion center is not possible, e.g., due to communication cost or privacy reasons. More precisely, we introduce a distributed iterative soft thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that consists of three steps: an averaging step, a gradient step, and a soft thresholding operation. We prove the convergence of DISTA in networks represented by regular graphs, and we compare it with existing methods in terms of performance, memory, and complexity.",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chiara Ravazzi"", ids = ""1927665""); list(name = ""Sophie Fosson"", ids = ""32769153""); list(name = ""Enrico Magli"", ids = ""1702477"")",02f3fad4eaf2b2465ae9bf8cae17298a7bc8844c; 3784fb7eeb7cb57af6fa62d164098c10eeb42f8a; 647ff1686a8bd8fc296428beadea469cd3f0f695; 462143f7f90452445f030ccf40aa46ee255e97e9; 5307fe15c06f4bcb691790e6327277adbcb82be3; 294f9c8327b61588cc5cc78a87de104cbe50a524; 282763c9492a4da5b3b68fd37b2331051f84ecb5; 6a63265b6d6523add10524d04a4434149f46bc90; e6a37d32a48faf943d485c3da05f428c90eb1e4d; 39202d7828e77c27700a243cf6724174cc8d5539,773c5c6a135b4082f735054c14960210c06ec54a; 77269f08b025aa4acc8e6039d4b11d17379bb9cd; 4b3d5bb0f9597fff321d3d48e0d22b2cae7e648a; eca39922b65b91c53c195f0ea6c1380850f2db19; b73bfcf834c0de094afc2b0ecb3df8e4d3ec7bb3; 712714f0733510e0f8a3634932d739a1e193544b; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; e4163a51f0abf89852d3698add9e79da3b402211; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 86b406119c3c7b6443b6eccd5b566cb71b25716c; f6c3b74e5e1d89b56da324edc87958659c05c8bf,2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),,3429-3434
00d28317d5c75c369c1ac8b38aa9143462c3aad5,A Projection Neural Network for the Generalized Lasso.,"The generalized lasso (GLasso) is an extension of the lasso regression in which there is an lâ‚ penalty term (or regularization) of the linearly transformed coefficient vector. Finding the optimal solution of GLasso is not straightforward since the penalty term is not differentiable. This brief presents a novel one-layer neural network to solve the generalized lasso for a wide range of penalty transformation matrices. The proposed neural network is proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges globally to the optimal solution of the GLasso. It is also shown that the proposed neural solution can solve many optimization problems, including sparse and weighted sparse representations, (weighted) total variation denoising, fused lasso signal approximator, and trend filtering. Disparate experiments on the above problems illustrate and confirm the excellent performance of the proposed neural network in comparison to other competing techniques.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Majid Mohammadi"", ids = ""151505333"")",e473af8d54a596b61e9a9be1d2d8af30a0a05a3a,,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,,
