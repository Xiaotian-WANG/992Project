7831728d360368d2eef76ebe6369d26c0c1ca89f,Group lassoing change-points in piecewise-stationary AR signals,"Regularizing the least-squares criterion with the total number of coefficient changes, it is possible to estimate time-varying (TV) autoregressive (AR) models with piecewise-constant coefficients. Such models emerge in various applications including speech segmentation, biomedical signal processing, and geophysics. To cope with the inherent lack of continuity and the high computational burden when dealing with high-dimensional data sets, this paper introduces a convex regularization approach enabling efficient and continuous estimation of TV-AR models. To this end, the problem is cast as a sparse regression one with grouped variables, and is solved by resorting to the group least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling to signal segmentation. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to implement the novel segmentation method. Issues regarding regularization and uniqueness of the solution are also discussed. Finally, an alternative segmentation technique is introduced to improve the detection of change instants. Numerical tests using synthetic and real data corroborate the merits of the developed segmentation techniques in identifying piecewise-constant TV-AR models.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Daniele Angelosante"", ids = ""49945935""); list(name = ""Georgios B.

05c0ecd578f42ac870b34b9227677f036b189b8f,Feature-specific penalized latent class analysis for genomic data.,"Genomic data are often characterized by a moderate to large number of categorical variables observed for relatively few subjects. Some of the variables may be missing or noninformative. An example of such data is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a dichotomous variable, observed on a moderate number of genetic markers. We first consider a latent class model where, conditional on unobserved membership in one of k classes, the variables are independent with probabilities determined by a regression model of low dimension q. Using a family of penalties including the ridge and LASSO, we extend this model to address higher-dimensional problems. Finally, we present an orthogonal map that transforms marker space to a space of ""features"" for which the constrained model has better predictive power. We demonstrate these methods on LOH data collected at 19 markers from 93 brain tumor patients. For this data set, the existing unpenalized latent class methodology does not produce estimates. Additionally, we show that posterior classes obtained from this method are associated with survival for these patients.",2006,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""E.

7ff3cd8c95900a22c77ad3c03fc7a81a753b847f,Efficient RNA isoform identification and quantification from RNA-Seq data with network flows,"MOTIVATION
Several state-of-the-art methods for isoform identification and quantification are based on [Formula: see text]-regularized regression, such as the Lasso. However, explicitly listing the-possibly exponentially-large set of candidate transcripts is intractable for genes with many exons. For this reason, existing approaches using the [Formula: see text]-penalty are either restricted to genes with few exons or only run the regression algorithm on a small set of preselected isoforms.


RESULTS
We introduce a new technique called FlipFlop, which can efficiently tackle the sparse estimation problem on the full set of candidate isoforms by using network flow optimization. Our technique removes the need of a preselection step, leading to better isoform identification while keeping a low computational cost. Experiments with synthetic and real RNA-Seq data confirm that our approach is more accurate than alternative methods and one of the fastest available.

Multikolinearitas merupakan salah satu pelanggaran asumsi klasik pada analisis regresi linear berganda yang disebabkan adanya hubungan linear diantara sebagian atau seluruh variabel independen dalam sebuah model regresi. Salah satu metode yang dapat menyelesaikan model regresi linear berganda yang terdapat multikolinearitas yaitu regresi Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Regresi LASSO mampu mengatasi masalah multikolinearitas dengan menyusutkan koefisien taksirannya mendekati nol, bahkan dapat hingga tepat nol. Sedemikian sehingga regresi LASSO dapat menyeleksi variabel di dalam model regresi. Regresi LASSO tidak memiliki solusi secara eksplisit dalam menentukan koefisien taksirannya, dengan demikiaN sehingga dibutuhkan pemrograman komputasi untuk menyelesaikannya. Algoritma LARS merupakan algoritma yang sangat efektif dalam membantu menyelesaikan solusi regresi LASSO secara komputasi. Dalam penelitian ini, diambil studi kasus mengenai inflasi yang terjadi di Indonesia tahun 2014-2017 sehingga inflasi merupakan variabel dependen dalam penelitian ini. Sedangkan variabel variabel independen yang terdapat dalam penelitian ini yaitu Produk Domestik Bruto, Ekspor Bersih, Jumlah Uang Beredar, Nilai Tukar Rupiah, Suku Bunga, Harga Beras, Upah Buruh Tani, dan Harga Minyak Dunia. Variabel-variabel independen tersebut termasuk pembahasan ekonomi makro yang besar kemungkinan saling mempengaruhi satu sama lain sehingga besar kemungkinan pula terjadinya multikolinearitas pada model regresi. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah menentukan variabel-variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap inflasi di Indonesia tahun 2014-2017 menggunakan regresi LASSO dan dibantu algoritma LARS dalam hal komputasi. Hasil dari penelitian ini diperoleh bahwa variabel-variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap inflasi yaitu Produk Domestik Bruto, Ekspor Bersih, Nilai Tukar Rupiah, Suku Bunga, Harga Beras, dan Upah Buruh Tani. Kata Kunci : Multikolinearitas, Regresi LASSO, LARS . REGRESI LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR (LASSO) IN THE CASE OF INFLATION IN INDONESIA, 2014-2017 ASTRACT. Multicollinearity is one of the violations of classical assumptions in multiple linear regression analysis due to a linear relationship between some or all of the independent variables in a regression model. One method that can solve the multiple linear regression model that contains multicollinearity is the regression of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). LASSO regression is able to solve the problem of multicollinearity by shrinking the estimated coefficients close to zero and even up to exactly zero, so that LASSO regression can select variables in the regression model. LASSO regression does not have an explicit solution of the estimated coefficient so that computational programming is needed to solve it. The LARS algorithm is a very effective algorithm in helping to solve the solutions of the LASSO regression. In this study, a case study was carried out on inflation that occurred in Indonesia in 2014-2017 so that inflation was the dependent variable in the model. In other side, the independent variables contained in this study are Gross Domestic Product, Net Export, Money Supply, Rupiah Exchange Rate, Interest Rate, Rice Price, Farmer Labor Wages, and World Oil Prices. These independent variables, including macroeconomic discussions, are likely to influence each other so that there is probably contain multicollinearity in the regression model. The purpose of this study is to determine the variables that influence inflation in Indonesia in 2014-2017 using LASSO regression and assisted by LARS algorithm. The results of this study found that the variables that influence inflation are Gross Domestic Product, Net Export, Rupiah Exchange Rate, Interest Rates, Rice Prices, and Farmer Labor Wages.

We mainly establish the degrees of freedom of the underlying stochastic model, which is one of the important topics to construct adaptive selection criteria for efficiently selecting the optimal model fit. Under some mild conditions, we prove that the degrees of freedom of mixed matrix regression model are the sum of the degrees of freedom of Lasso and regularized matrix regression. Moreover, we establish the degrees of freedom of nuclear-norm regularization multivariate regression.

It is shown that under suitable sparsity conditions, the residual empirical process based on the ALASSO provides valid inference methodology in very high dimensional regression problems where conventional methods fail. It is also shown that the ALASSO based residual empirical process satisfies a functional oracle property, i.e., in addition to selecting the set of relevant variables with probability tending to one, the ALASSO based residual empirical process converges to the same limiting Gaussian process as the OLS based residual empirical process under the oracle. The functional oracle property is critically exploited to construct asymptotically valid confidence bands for the error distribution function and prediction intervals for unobserved values of the response variable in the high dimensional set up, where traditional non-penalized methods are known to fail. Simulation results are presented illustrating finite sample performance of the proposed methodology.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Avipsita Chatterjee"", ids = ""145541852""); list(name = ""Sandeep K.

568c0138e735e0ce18f3f527d1dc163527cad49e,50 Volatile organic compounds predict the last week of life in lung cancer patients,"Background Recognising dying is difficult and is an ongoing difficulty for doctors. We believe there is a process to dying and animal studies support this theory. We previously demonstrated that a number of volatile organic compounds in urine, change in the last weeks and days of life of patients in a small mixed cancer group. We needed to verify this finding in a suitably powered follow-up study. Method We prospectively collected urine samples from people with lung cancer. We aimed to compare samples from 25 people in each of the last 3 weeks of life to a control group, 50 people with lung cancer who lived 3 or more months from the time of sampling. The urine samples were analysed for volatile organic compounds by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to analyse the GC-MS data and create a statistical model. Results We recruited 162 people in total; 29 in the last week; 28 in the second last week; 30 in the third last week of life; 74 controls i.e. samples taken >3 months from death; 424 urine samples. A model was created to predict whether a patient would die within 1â€‰week. It has an optimism corrected AUC of 0.851 (95% CI: 0.767, 0.911); sensitivity 78.6% (95% CI: (64.3%, 89.3%)); specificity 83.1% (95% CI: (69.9%, 92.3%)). The model identified a selection of compounds that contributed to the identification of patients who were close to death. Discussion The results confirm that volatile organic compounds can predict when people with lung cancer are in the last week of life. Our model to predict when a person with lung cancer is in the last week of life is approximately 80% accurate.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""SÃ©amus Coyle"", ids = ""39577368""); list(name = ""Evelina Chapman"", ids = ""51021861""); list(name = ""Stephen E Mason"", ids = ""144398321""); list(name = ""Dez Hughes"", ids = ""37440642""); list(name = ""Marley Boyd"", ids = ""144186522""); list(name = ""Chris Probert"", ids = ""90986325""); list(name = ""John E Ellershaw"", ids = ""48947087"")",,,BMJ,9,

It replaces the original variables with low-dimensional linear combinations of predictors without any loss of regression information and without the need to prespecify a model or an error distribution. However, it suffers from the fact that each SIR component is a linear combination of all the original predictors; thus, it is often difficult to interpret the extracted components. By representing SIR as a regression-type optimization problem, we propose in this article a new method, called sparse SIR, that combines the shrinkage idea of the lasso with SIR to produce both accurate and sparse solutions.

6a7eb317138d0aa148912cbb69eb0e853701b81d,Left atrial shape predicts recurrence after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation,"INTRODUCTION
Multiple markers left atrium (LA) remodeling, including LA shape, correlate with outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF). Catheter ablation is an important treatment of AF, but better tools are needed to determine which patients will benefit. In this study, we use particle-based modeling to quantitatively assess LA shape, and determine to what degree it predicts AF recurrence after catheter ablation.


METHODS AND RESULTS
There were 254 patients enrolled in the DECAAF study who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of the LA prior to AF ablation and were followed for recurrence for up to 475 days. We performed particle-based shape modeling on each patient's LA shape. We selected shape parameters using the LASSO method and factor analysis, and then added them to a Cox regression model, which included multiple clinical parameters and LA fibrosis. We computed Harrell's C-statistic with and without shape in the model. We used the model to stratify patients into recurrence risk classes by both shape and shape and fibrosis combined. Three shape parameters were selected for inclusion. The C-statistic increased from 0.68 to 0.72 when shape was added to the model (PÂ <Â 0.05). Visualized shapes showed that a more round LA shape with a shorter, more laterally rotated appendage was predictive of recurrence.


CONCLUSION
LA shape is an independent predictor of recurrence after AF ablation. When combined with LA fibrosis, shape analysis using PBM may improve patient selection for ablation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Erik T Bieging"", ids = ""6763695""); list(name = ""Alan K.

Just as the classical linear regression methods estimate model for the conditional mean function, quantile regression offers a mechanism for estimating models for the conditional median function, and the full range of other conditional quantile functions. In the Bayesian approach to variable selection prior distributions representing the subjective beliefs about the parameters are assigned to the regression coefficients. The estimation of parameters and the selection of the best subset of variables is accomplished by using adaptive lasso quantile regression. In this paper we describe, compare, and apply the two suggested Bayesian approaches. The two suggested Bayesian suggested approaches are used to select the best subset of variables and estimate the parameters of the quantile regression equation when small sample sizes are used. Simulations show that the proposed approaches are very competitive in terms of variable selection, estimation accuracy and efficient when small sample sizes are used.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Neveen Sayed-Ahmed"", ids = ""1412388865"")",400fec61b10b9fd198958528c9b2f824f4b7f0fd,35e47dab8108f69d0c8785a0e4291cc6fd331b9f; 5565df5479f0b470aa19389973e22e86fc8783b1; f62d4ec82aad2add9d14f3d2319a5ccc7d992cb3; 283ce96d3f71a1ca956e5f41e9d6a81844347cab; f46b5cb13bdf4f1794edce52c70dcc45c9d93ffa; af32919a11d493820f70f5d117b57829e060d230; 3c30cc3d7ce23705543aa06b82fa70d7df638717; 73e6d410f380af0ed85a5284952a8d01047f1e86; c09db7439505f49a0958f68e782df94b3807341a; eb6040037bbf3692d19ffdd93e29d6f8992b4788; bca3bc3708a657cc6775a649ba5e31837ba836a6; 9a8a9372f92d8918a73e0bb42d372689cdd462d6; c53bf607fd24e89abf24158a7067bfab133ce52c; 6ac932da2c895ac4245062ac26155cc6c6d3e420; 336c0b2077ec80c5ed11629333511f9a8da978b8; a5a6fb8aabe8a4721afa1870a207267ea3f93c15; 07e1986ad81cd951036abf757779811a4aac9152; 27cc6d30462e484923496827f3ba30e7860b4568; b70c815094ed3d9b2decf222677de7faf7564a35; 8b1740efa9bf584ea038fb8b1b7bbe4d73c92045; de68633453cec5a4b9ae5282a44b77a22ea0c7ec; 929f3b0b1e63d96ed2c3942ae4eaa88d6bfbf8bf; b98054f4a8582af49c77e53fcd9e68328ce7c01e; 585b4192d1d0926b8ff0428666ea1bd5f64db4af,,,1-13
973775b35f8b604d922c2056f724bd37e24fde10,Optimizing deep learning networks using multi-armed bandits,"Deep learning has gained significant attention recently following their successful use for applications such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These deep learning models are based on very large neural networks, which can require a significant amount of memory and hence limit the range of applications. Hence, this study explores methods for pruning deep learning models as a way of reducing their size, and computational time, but without sacrificing their accuracy. A literature review was carried out, revealing existing approaches for pruning, their strengths, and weaknesses. A key issue emerging from this review is that there is a trade-off between removing a weight or neuron and the potential reduction in accuracy. Thus, this study develops new algorithms for pruning that utilize a framework, known as a multi-armed bandit, which has been successfully applied in applications where there is a need to learn which option to select given the outcome of trials. There are several different multi-arm bandit methods, and these have been used to develop new algorithms including those based on the following types of multi-arm bandits: (i) Epsilon-Greedy (ii) Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (iii) Thompson Sampling and (iv) Exponential Weight Algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3). The algorithms were implemented in Python and a comprehensive empirical evaluation of their performance was carried out in comparison to both the original neural network models and existing algorithms for pruning. The existing methods that are compared include: Random Pruning, Greedy Pruning, Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS). The thesis also includes an empirical comparison with a number of other learning methods such as KNN, decision trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, logistic regression, Gaussian process classifier, kernel ridge regression, LASSO regression, linear regression, Bayesian Ridge regression, boosting, bagging and random forests. The results on the data sets show that some of the new methods (i) generalize better than the original model and most of the other methods such as KNN and decision trees (ii) outperform OBS and OBD in terms of reduction in size, generalization, and computational time (iii) outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of accuracy.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sa Ameen"", ids = ""144485893"")",,305d689afb6574ffec7b01e24431d541d0ce6f5d; 56827dbe2e25ba59668822369cd0bfb6a5e2ce6a; 4aa9f5150b46320f534de4747a2dd0cd7f3fe292; 3a13f79183eaa6641ad4747c1714d79abb4c4250; 9fa9777415729cebfcbcb5ee667057e981f9912e; c369d4807adeff168a6fef1dd7986d62fc150a78; b93c16c8adcc21c8289f0f7ac4bb5d8addb8be53; 9cc52cea162e5a7a364eca39626d596ebfb91886; 1c2c11e60755fc1df95f57edc37875e2b43cd946; 2a802bd3c0d63ee1e43f1e31633e90b399c1a789; 397de65a9a815ec39b3704a79341d687205bc80a; 649d03490ef72c5274e3bccd03d7a299d2f8da91; ea4ffbb3d628cd0739b04b67a1d4c3c7ccf75beb; df50df30706ba37eacc41b6f6ee9f2aa0e806a5b; 3413f80ef728da6c0473cabe1e57cd7fd84c53fe; 02b28f3b71138a06e40dbd614abf8568420ae183; 37093aa23e97f1934dfb62a3149ed66be80bfabc; 31fd2bafb3b5186ffa637adc282ba766a4108dd9; 5d90f06bb70a0a3dced62413346235c02b1aa086; 02227c94dd41fe0b439e050d377b0beb5d427cda; f9b02923356605dd41d8c010214568381ae798ac; 22720d75b8c73afd3bf4917fd5512dcc11e19885; b21c78a62fbb945a19ae9a8935933711647e7d70; 46f30e94dd3d5902141c5fbe58d0bc9189545c76; abb33d75dc297993fcc3fb75e0f4498f413eb4f6; 23bdd2d82068419bf4923e6a0198fc0fa4468807; 8f1408d33858a78f90f9000a34856664fc639ae4; 8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a; 53072edcceb505388b86d0448f43325008ad96d5; 1839e17555160bd897b978c48b8ebd13dd21445f; 4fe1c707a48869cbbdf3eb0384e526d1d294f7e2; 40212e9474c3ddf3d8c6ffd13dd3211ec9406c49; 06571537e6210772e622eee2cba877d053332985; 0c1f9ca23f4f09ecfc44bcc8ca1c2736624f4652; 76a3325fcb27a22cb5cef0e801a5e2b808c4648a; ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292; 91c68fe8851bfdb660797f30e39376c4de80ede4; 2f83f6e1afadf0963153974968af6b8342775d82,,,

(Proc Natl Acad Sci 110(36):14557â€“14562, 2013) study the distribution of robust regression estimators in the regime in which the number of parameters p is of the same order as the number of samples n. Using numerical simulations and â€˜highly plausibleâ€™ heuristic arguments, they unveil a striking new phenomenon. Namely, the regression coefficients contain an extra Gaussian noise component that is not explained by classical concepts such as the Fisher information matrix. We show here that that this phenomenon can be characterized rigorously using techniques that were developed by the authors for analyzing the Lasso estimator under high-dimensional asymptotics. We introduce an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to compute M-estimators and deploy state evolution to evaluate the operating characteristics of AMP and so also M-estimates. Our analysis clarifies that the â€˜extra Gaussian noiseâ€™ encountered in this problem is fundamentally similar to phenomena already studied for regularized least squares in the setting $$n",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""David L.

8b8e8339640f36e44b38ec5aeb97291f9f91a963,Identifying individual sleep apnea/hypoapnea epochs using smartphone-based pulse oximetry,"Sleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories, thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 and pulse rate variability [PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events. Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data (40%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing data (60%), used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 81%; the model provided a median accuracy of 74% sensitivity of 75%, and specificity of 73% when using a risk threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 73% However, the performance might decrease when analyzing subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ainara Garde"", ids = ""19191888""); list(name = ""Parastoo Dekhordi"", ids = ""7326582""); list(name = ""J.

7a76d443c2234cd7d56498b70b9ef109ec97f0eb,Implementation of genome-wide selection in wheat,"With the expected development of thousands of molecular markers in most crops, the marker-assisted selection theory has recently shifted from the use of a few markers targeted in QTL regions (or derived from candidate or validated genes) to the use of many more markers covering the whole genome. These genome-wide markers are already used for association analysis between polymorphisms for anonymous markers and qualitative or quantitative traits. The condition for success is that a sufficient level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) exists between the adjacent markers used for genotyping and the true genes or QTLs. This LD is known to vary among species and type of genetic material. In selfing species, particularly among breeding lines, LD has been reported to range up to 1 cM or more. In such conditions, uncharacterized markers can be used to predict the breeding value of a trait without referring to actual QTLs. We present an example applying DArT markers to the INRA wheat breeding material in an attempt to implement whole genome selection as an alternative to phenotypic selection. This study assesses different models (GBLUP, Ridge Regression BLUP, Bayesian Ridge Regression and Lasso) and their ability to predict the yields of genotypes evaluated in a multi-site network from 2000 to 2009 in a highly unbalanced design. The prediction coefficients obtained by cross-validation techniques are encouraging, given the small size of the training population.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Gilles Charmet"", ids = ""5809648""); list(name = ""Eric William Storlie"", ids = ""6854103"")",5c829c0f65db6d97d1a3c89815303fc73bb54762; c93b9dab91d1d4acc7462b16bc1bd0ecada06a15; aea5e6b2694117a500e9ddc2df49a9d95dda5827; c1e1e351beb2cbaff31e425d30edd03ebc27cc0b; 085eea342ed090257a90ac319d511ccd32b63094; e5c69a5ef6a37f7d95b720c53c604ebb1074585b; 85914cf89692d5799bd48f5ca24598a0bd9be09b,c3c8fdcf6568405f01cd6745de8d29456a2c99df; 76c65b0ae575393753bc5c4cb68334ae3168a84e; e7d93d5c5c53fa3c6a47c389395c40737c148ff8; 186fdc90670975056057993bd441932d87749870; bdca45519783abd80ab6e0bca062695384cd1eca; 0507e2ae99ae2aa6606e3573934045c2d4b7fa89; 26e614f011e62d6985d82b809b43de0bada9729d; 72dee002172d47e1e2c22092b530311e43250f10; f47fdfc515a6443f107c255d60b4984436441baa; e0ad65c018f9cafe68ffc303bb88aaa7cc793b45; f3621cf1faeb361c1b0b604af1da73b06f99c930; fa78c9383d9603cff6b08841633a5c67409d477f; 8de0f4d3168750a2509a7ef72131e055aba4c674; 9d7f58acc89bdbc180468eb5ce61bb47cd56379a; c897a62c5518be5427e33aaed0315a1b2bd72551; 5e9dda9ec09f5847735d96a8a3cb89169fdd5ec7; 8b338a8ed6809137537f4a35b30ccdb32068894c; 433eb3f2260e7e27245ff969aa652edb90255bbe,Russian Journal of Genetics: Applied Research,2,298-303
86f57fcee895a88fc57ef6a42d63a354241bf90d,Monitoring seasonal influenza epidemics by using internet search data with an ensemble penalized regression model,"Seasonal influenza epidemics cause serious public health problems in China. Search queries-based surveillance was recently proposed to complement traditional monitoring approaches of influenza epidemics. However, developing robust techniques of search query selection and enhancing predictability for influenza epidemics remains a challenge. This study aimed to develop a novel ensemble framework to improve penalized regression models for detecting influenza epidemics by using Baidu search engine query data from China. The ensemble framework applied a combination of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and rank aggregation method to optimize penalized regression models. Different algorithms including lasso, ridge, elastic net and the algorithms in the proposed ensemble framework were compared by using Baidu search engine queries. Most of the selected search terms captured the peaks and troughs of the time series curves of influenza cases.

5bb9cc7c122f9b071acc645582c522ff863d153f,"Protocol for a prospective, observational cohort study of awareness in mechanically ventilated patients admitted from the emergency department: the ED-AWARENESS study","INTRODUCTION
Awareness with paralysis is a complication with potentially devastating psychological consequences for mechanically ventilated patients. While rigorous investigation into awareness has occurred for operating room patients, little attention has been paid outside of this domain. Mechanically ventilated patients in the emergency department (ED) have been historically managed in a way that predisposes them to awareness events: high incidence of neuromuscular blockade use, underdosing of analgesia and sedation, delayed administration of analgesia and sedation after intubation, and a lack of monitoring of sedation targets and depth. These practice patterns are discordant to recommendations for reducing the incidence of awareness, suggesting there is significant rationale to examine awareness in the ED population.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
This is a single centre, prospective cohort study examining the incidence of awareness in mechanically ventilated ED patients. A cohort of 383 mechanically ventilated ED patients will be included. The primary outcome is awareness with paralysis. Qualitative reports of all awareness events will be provided. Recognising the potential problem with conventional multivariable analysis arising from a small number of events (expected less than 10-phenomenon of separation), Firth penalised method, exact logistic regression model or penalised maximum likelihood estimation shrinkage (Ridge, LASSO) will be used to assess for predictors of awareness.


ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
Approval of the study by the Human Research Protection Office has been obtained.

4db5c2407a78c5c693cdad2cc9b93e9d9d474ced,Memory Cocktail Therapy: A General Learning-Based Framework to Optimize Dynamic Tradeoffs in NVMs,"Non-volatile memories (NVMs) have attracted significant interest recently due to their high-density, low static power, and persistence. There are, however, several challenges associated with building practical systems from NVMs, including limited write endurance and long latencies. Researchers have proposed a variety of architectural techniques which can achieve different tradeoffs between lifetime, performance and energy efficiency; however, no individual technique can satisfy requirements for all applications and different objectives. Hence, we propose Memory Cocktail Therapy (MCT), a general learning-based framework that adaptively chooses the best techniques for the current application and objectives.Specifically, MCT performs four procedures to adapt the techniques to various scenarios. First, MCT formulates a high-dimensional configuration space from all different combinations of techniques. Second, MCT selects primary features from the configuration space with lasso regularization. Third, MCT estimates lifetime, performance and energy consumption using lightweight online predictors (eg. quadratic regression and gradient boosting) and a small set of configurations guided by the selected features. Finally, given the estimation of all configurations, MCT selects the optimal configuration based on the user-defined objectives. As a proof of concept, we test MCTâ€™s ability to guarantee different lifetime targets and achieve 95% of maximum performance, while minimizing energy consumption. We find that MCT improves performance by 9.24% and reduces energy by 7.95% compared to the best static configuration. Moreover, the performance of MCT is 94.49% of the ideal configuration with only 5.3% more energy consumption.

45acc51886468c98191aeb489f868ac3a3c9c8a9,Super-resolution for sequence series data using long-short term memory network,"Sequence Series Data (SSD) refers to multi-dimensional data involving measurements over sequences, which can be ordered. This type of data is frequently encountered in genomic data sets and text sentiment analysis data sets, but collecting them can be time-consuming and labour-intensive. These factors result in low-resolution data sets. Therefore, we employed six machine learning regression methods to perform SSD super-resolution, i.e. to recover high-resolution data sets using self-similarity in low-resolution data sets. Furthermore, we propose a novel Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, namely Interaction Encoded LSTM (IELSTM) network, which is capable of handling multiple distant interactions among sequences. IELSTM network generally shows better overall reconstruction quality when compared with ridge regression, LASSO regression, orthogonal matching pursuit regression, multilayer perceptron regression, and random forest regression, on four genomic data sets.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pak-Kan Wong"", ids = ""33994159""); list(name = ""Man Leung Wong"", ids = ""1951350""); list(name = ""Kwong-Sak Leung"", ids = ""144446033"")",,8c571314311f507731296b21b56ab2c326b97392; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 16758855b5a89cf7ffa391aa64caa42532a48246; 89f62dd328cb3e0e7b1a7e03e5b39084b4a91d18; 54e325aee6b2d476bbbb88615ac15e251c6e8214; 0504945cc2d03550fecb6ff02e637f9421107c25; 7cbc6ccb2d14962402f389e03f69925e5328b578; 786d771c10557998864f147291c4e2291b505931; 9fa3720371e78d04973ce9752781bc337480b68f; 32de44f01a96d4473d21099d15e25bc2b9f08e2f; 5dcb131e1b335b14f712e31bc6a487e697f1b29b; b36b7f7c68923d14ba2859b5d28a1124616a8c89; d8c0f0a243070ba05883befce0095a633186dd53; 66e9dc728b5041271bff0cd6ac0d7eadcd88442f; 57499df833a1c16fde619d62a1dfc2b474923422; 2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d; 6e633b41d93051375ef9135102d54fa097dc8cf8; ee1f8a20ebfe7b7c03b867daa1b98c0758e7e5cd; fc4088d4dbdf68f7d73eac51b1a583434f57df38; 44d2abe2175df8153f465f6c39b68b76a0d40ab9; 42d60f7faaa2f6fdd2b928c352d65eb57b4791aa; 2946c4e29b057d3543f09b89f547965895676d19; 9c842b2926fd60b9e6ff80fee28c65e7c1ae5f1d; 969610ca2ff299fe55cce7568c3d7445359cfe36; ee2f476aef2180588ec53703485b9d6cbab15044; df0c54fe61f0ffb9f0e36a17c2038d9a1964cba3; 3de5d40b60742e3dfa86b19e7f660962298492af; 4177ec52d1b80ed57f2e72b0f9a42365f1a8598d; f3cb2b0b4c1fc5cd06d20ceabb7ebfccdce90ad8; ff2c2e3e83d1e8828695484728393c76ee07a101; cbd1ade5b869b13d1853aa0753b82fb35c26bcba; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; f99d0bd1f1288fe35d46f719125844bfbaf544e3; 2f83f6e1afadf0963153974968af6b8342775d82; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 067e07b725ab012c80aa2f87857f6791c1407f6d; bf07f78601c6447bd115195a012a1315609ea8a1; 168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74; 0b4c2ca8910db73f6c23c85334fa227d55386009,2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),,1-8
783fc2e2fcb251f9546495cbc7de681ec5499006,Adaptive Generalized Fused-Lasso: Asymptotic Properties and Applications,"The Lasso has been widely studied and used in many applications over the last decade. It has also been extended in various directions in particular to ensure asymptotic oracle properties through adaptive weights (Zou, 2006). Another direction has been to incorporate additional knowledge within the penalty to account for some structure among features. Among such strategies the Fused-Lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) has recently been extended to penalize differences of coefficients corresponding to features organized along a network, through the Generalized Fused-Lasso. In this work we investigate the theoretical and empirical properties of the Adaptive Generalized Fused-Lasso in the context of Generalized Linear Models, with emphasis on Logistic Regression. More precisely, we establish its asymptotic oracle properties and propose an extensive simulation study to explore its empirical properties. We especially show that it compares favorably with other strategies. We also propose an adaptation of the Relaxed Lasso (Meinshausen, 2007). Finally we present an original application of the Generalized Fused-Lasso to the Joint Modeling framework where the design itself suggests the graph to be used in the penalty; an illustration is provided on road safety data.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Vivian Viallon"", ids = ""49582889""); list(name = ""Sophie Lambert-Lacroix"", ids = ""1399070559""); list(name = ""Holger HÃ¶fling"", ids = ""2549144""); list(name = ""Franck Picard"", ids = ""50108387"")",6632266ca9f7f291ad62baa6af12dc3428ee0b96; 8bcd20fde539911e70cd01b0d223e1378f55e9e7; f8ff50d43b4be1ec89727405f938ddaa36fe121a; f559bc3291047e86fd7c148d795bb7b9406067e9; 0d6d335f3c9d62045a1077ba3e5a4584b89b2191,a0d4b6eb9adbde01ec1b060aaf75a076a6a8b622; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; b68111d2e692bbc1e5708b9d0de346e9e12577d4; 4946fee89f2965d684ae34404c452389cd4eeb68; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; e40b44e4f20d185a9b09e29ffd11cb0f5977b63b; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; c4b21299f48e9c4384671a4d963167e5a79fd36b; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 7d28a7fd02abb575162af89695240fab75b29b60; ccd1282aea3cc7c3d40300d82472fc5f9f54cb8e; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; db1ddf07cc4dd8da5c2c7d8e39de1f705bbedf2b; ef767b585b5d72e2194060060100d349b1f0486d; a17a7bc1570db0e50761383c121d4df31d9d5d2e; 419c999432f38c89d4f40da5393832e73d937c89; 222d4f7cdbe34fe8179f8482cd0f582f103367f6; 7e7b3a0d014fe5686c2ac1dd85e68efe6fd96fb4; 86c35680190dcb1a040243927e98e4ca08f8d80e; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d9b9fb207013bf8afb064f23f3dffc7edd005f73; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 2d5989cfdd0bcd0ccb1f535e2d523755e8feacb3; e49fb5b876f6575750ed42d75238a80c9a838a00; aa0a928ff2d304666f9a4d03586dcbdc3039dc61; 107d657e059e6d9cf9eba7104729e17f569c5e52; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; 2c9ced7f9ddc9c256a1dea9c1bbb357fcd0ed18e; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; d49fcaf2314659817b433b6fb13e386bc365d034; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 3534de0faddb6f0d0806b8b98b36ff36a8b2e449,,,
fddceb4129f2a6cb9e152a6b3743d65188dfa8f2,Identification of a 26-lncRNAs Risk Model for Predicting Overall Survival of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.,"As a common malignancy in women, cervical squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) can function as potential biomarkers in cancer prognosis; however, little is known about its role in cervical cancer. In this study, we downloaded the gene expression profiles along with the clinical data of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By applying bioinformatics analysis including random forest selection and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) cox regression model along with 10-fold cross-validation, we constructed a 26-lncRNAs risk model that can be used to predict the overall survival of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. After that, Kaplan-Meier analysis combined with log-rank p test was applied to assess the predictive accuracy of the 26-lncRNAs risk model. Further analysis showed that the prognostic value of 26-lncRNAs risk model was independent of other clinicopathological factors. At last, lncRNAs in the model were put into gene ontology biological process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways analysis, which suggested that these lncRNAs might contribute to cancer-associated processes such as cell cycle and apoptosis. This study indicated that lncRNAs signature could be a useful marker to predict the prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yu Mao"", ids = ""144498883""); list(name = ""Zhanzhao Fu"", ids = ""35334791""); list(name = ""Lixin Dong"", ids = ""145084062""); list(name = ""Yue Zheng"", ids = ""47833883""); list(name = ""Jing Dong"", ids = ""143863957""); list(name = ""Xin Li"", ids = ""144485786"")",854687ee2c71fe9b808c410ca9cd124fa6b344e4; 49a2a099f9ce962c47a492b2c1b16732ac286476; 601349c0de7ced07e82fb42c932256d7b5b7ca91; ce1beac4606a0bd32df21589088e19770cf7870f,,DNA and cell biology,38 4,"

2b8bd4087bba4bd419222752f4c2af7c163edb6c,Mining the WHO Drug Safety Database Using Lasso Logistic Regression,"For reasons such as low incidence, occurrence in groups frequently excluded from clinical trials and long onset times, some adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of a new medicinal product stay unnoticed until after market launch. The World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) continuously collect spontaneous ADR reports from the entire world and use data mining approaches to detect which drugs are most likely to cause which previously unanticipated ADRs. This WHO drug safety database, being the largest of its kind, comprises about 3.8 million accumulated reports. The currently used data mining methods are based on two-dimensional projections of the data with respect to a given drug-ADR combination. This combination is then given an association score based on the discrepancy between the observed and expected number of reports on it. In this thesis these disproportionality-based methods are represented by the information component (IC) measure of the UMC, a shrunk Bayesian measure. A limitation with the IC is its incapability to deal with confounding by co-medication and masking. Confounding by co-medication means that the association between a drug and a certain ADR might seem stronger than it really is because that drug is used together with another drug, which in turn is truly associated with the ADR. Masking, on the other hand, is a phenomenon whereby a very strong association between an ADR and some drug might weaken the associations between that ADR and other drugs. Here a novel method to mine the WHO drug safety database is proposed to address these issues, the lasso logistic regression (LLR). Instead of studying each combination separately, in the LLR model the ADR under study is fixed and its presence on a report is predicted by the presence of all occurring drugs in the database, thus yielding a logistic regression framework. Further, independent prior Laplace distributions are put on the parameters, resulting in a lasso-type shrinkage where a subset of the parameters are shrunk to exactly zero. The LLR was confirmed to correct for confounding by co-medication and masking in simulated scenarios and specific clinical examples. Further, with a specific degree of shrinkage the LLR had 10 % higher recall and maintained precision in comparison to the IC with respect to a test database. Although its transparency is limited, the LLR has an important role to play in the future of ADR monitoring.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ola Caster"", ids = ""3004184"")",f6bd2b7889f0d8c9d3930b93453e457b1156b71b; 7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f; b156954d56186a6efd13584ab0284c4b1ecca964; 001198d3ef0d304718cfd64ff241d0133adcf928,e7f716ab4e23cfb423a4f6b19363678d922a76f3; fc3ae138f9cd67cbb97512c369783ce3bfbd4bc1; b39a904c2edcb1f4da776c94d044e7d108c08775; 809672c19835f14ed8d84cd25d1bc0c7c4f8f47f; c3991359ca3099efc6cadd21747a9d20c762e85d; 6a10eaedec9d402fb8d8b8900994d0aa27c5e129; 75eed5ac6176c3b031be354460b130e0123955a3; 4b846edcc41d6347f789df20ae08ca09c0504b1e; 460e76c3db066846055ac30fe852c9a75ec42f4e; 040cf85e53e48aab1512ed8dd02d994eea0e4bcc; d872fb15eee1e5daed36616fa10290040aef9c56; f2b1e0cbd13d5164e570b7bff7920bf4fd05fa55; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; 530168dd7875b79d5b1f393064e07d1b1a73af68; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; bc9b7746e252786e0581d55ff7aa12b9ebd8463a; 392b31ea1f78df3ffdb5f64be340050e8abec038; 0ee8b2999019216bc860ea5f6a51a56cedca17ea; 4d477cce0c041075bc8851d0588cb54c3dc5952d; aed0a148d5c6775f6b906b9b8a5d58dd6dac99d7; a6f5c8d82f27bd68eb4cc40bc3d0b00fccc5d469; 2c65e74142ac0fe999212ec1d60346520a6a9190; 0b6f2975f33db74f0ad7954053a80ce95d42eae6; 7aa39f7f3b69473705e247dd2b3a9689f10fbbc3; d49bfad00101a03ac3e964bea3717c75a5bb3210; 5b03ba5203850bd958779382f7c99f8f1f4d5293; 58151ddbc9185b210c66fde4804114da038f5d60,,,

Examining the role of developmental signaling pathways in ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma (patients with lung adenocarcinoma negative for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, ALK, RET, and ROS1 were identified as ""driver gene-negative"") may shed light on the clinical research and treatment for this lung adenocarcinoma subgroup. We aimed to investigate whether developmental signaling pathways activation can stratify the risk of ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In the discovery phase, we profiled the mRNA expression of each candidate gene using genome-wide microarrays in 52 paired lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. In the training phase, tissue microarrays and LASSO Cox regression analysis were applied to further screen candidate molecules in 189 patients, and we developed a predictive signature. In the validation phase, one internal cohort and two external cohorts were used to validate our novel prognostic signature.


RESULTS
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on whole-genome microarrays indicated that the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway was activated in ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-based gene expression profiles revealed 39 transcripts differentially expressed. Finally, a Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-based CSDW signature comprising 4 genes (CTNNB1 or Î²-catenin, SOX9, DVL3, and Wnt2b) was developed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter overall survival [HR, 10.42; 6.46-16.79; P < 0.001) than patients with low-risk scores.

The CSDW signature is a reliable prognostic tool and may represent genes that are potential drug targets for ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongmei Cui"", ids = ""47333092""); list(name = ""Wen-feng Fang"", ids = ""8514929""); list(name = ""Chaofeng Li"", ids = ""10519502""); list(name = ""Kejing Tang"", ids = ""49037488""); list(name = ""Jian Zhang"", ids = ""50561753""); list(name = ""Yiyan Lei"", ids = ""5327321""); list(name = ""Weiling He"", ids = ""48591317""); list(name = ""Sui Peng"", ids = ""4792089""); list(name = ""Ming Kuang"", ids = ""143865807""); list(name = ""Hui Zhang"", ids = ""48213066""); list(name = ""Lili Chen"", ids = ""27031611""); list(name = ""Di Xu"", ids = ""145481074""); list(name = ""Cuilan Tang"", ids = ""34517723""); list(name = ""Wenhui Zhang"", ids = ""50549732""); list(name = ""Yuxin Zhu"", ids = ""49780659""); list(name = ""Wenting Jiang"", ids = ""34611648""); list(name = ""Neng Qian Jiang"", ids = ""6833729""); list(name = ""Yu Dan Sun"", ids = ""46675547""); list(name = ""Yangshan Chen"", ids = ""24901842""); list(name = ""Hui Wang"", ids = ""49528650""); list(name = ""Yingrong Lai"", ids = ""7827664""); list(name = ""Shuhua Li"", ids = ""47319156""); list(name = ""Qiong He"", ids = ""145014802""); list(name = ""Jianwen Zhou"", ids = ""10164629""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""1698138""); list(name = ""Millicent Lin"", ids = ""5313462""); list(name = ""Honglei Chen"", ids = ""1751866""); list(name = ""Chenzhi Zhou"", ids = ""12134140""); list(name = ""Chunlin Wang"", ids = ""50097204""); list(name = ""Jianhong Wang"", ids = ""46584828""); list(name = ""Xuenong Zou"", ids = ""3881866""); list(name = ""Lian-tang Wang"", ids = ""49681250""); list(name = ""Zunfu Ke"", ids = ""38096824"")",53716f8125cdfa52ed7c1c75d9c0e034018fe42e; 6520f29c4b62a02288db741d1c9ce590ca1e6276; 3a614a2850f4acd9fdea109c2f91f428d603f29d,,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,25 5,"

309f7790053a105b0ddd7df9b9cb745e3c8c6e73,Oncogenic Predictors of Outcome in Older AML Patients Treated Intensively. Analysis of the ALFA-1200 Trial,"Context. The prognostic value of gene mutations in older AML patients (pts) treated intensively remains unclear. Only one study has explored the role of mutation patterns determined by NGS in older AML pts prospectively treated with various chemotherapies in years 2000-2010 (Eisfeld Leukemia 2018). Methods. Pts older than 60y enrolled in the ALFA-1200 trial (NCT01966497) between 09/2012 and 06/2016 were sequenced with a 37-gene myeloid panel. Pts received one 7+3 course followed by 2 intermediate-dose cytarabine courses. Pts with non-favorable risk were eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Variable selection for multivariate analyses was performed by lasso penalized regression including age, gender and log(WBC) as covariates. Results. Sequencing was done in 471 (93%) of the 509 enrolled pts. Median age and WBC count were 68y and 5.3x109/L, respectively (resp). CR (including CRp) was achieved in 341 (72%) pts and 90 underwent RIC-SCT in first CR. With a median follow-up of 25.4 months, median OS was 20.7 months. Pts had a median of 3 mutations (range 1-10). The 17 mostly frequently mutated genes (â‰¥5% of pts, by decreasing frequency: DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, ASXL1, FLT3, SRSF2, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, IDH1, STAG2, BCOR, TP53, PTPN11, U2AF1, EZH2 and KRAS) were retained for prognostic analyses. Genes belonging to a common pathway (eg. NRAS and KRAS) may have divergent prognostic values, preventing biology-informed grouping of mutations. Cytogenetic risk (derived from ELN 2017, Dohner Blood 2017, not considering gene mutations) was favorable (fav), intermediate (int), adverse (adv) and missing in 3%, 72%, 18% and 7% resp. Because of the few pts with fav cytogenetics in our cohort, pts were further grouped into non-adv and adv cytogenetics. CR rates and median OS were 75.6% vs 56.6% and 24.8 vs 9.5 months in pts with non-adv and adv cytogenetics, resp (both p In the 388 pts with non-adv cytogenetics, NPM1 mutations independently predicted improved CR rate (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.3, p=0.014), while mutations in ASXL1 (OR=0.46, p=0.012), RUNX1 (OR=0.46, p=0.013) and NRAS (OR=0.49, p=0.04) had independent adverse predictive value. In univariate analysis the shorter OS of FLT3-ITD pts was confined to allele ratiosâ‰¥ 0.5 (FLT3-ITDhigh, p=0.02). In a multivariate analysis accounting for clinical covariates, mutations in NPM1 (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.45, p In the 83 pts with adv cytogenetics, TP53 mutations predicted shorter OS (p=0.004). Among pts with adv cytogenetics, those without TP53 mutation had a median OS of 12.6 months and were thus classified as high risk while the median OS of the 30 pts with adv cytogenetics and TP53 mutations was only 5.4 months, defining very high risk disease. This stratification resulted in improved OS prediction compared to the full molecular ELN 2017 (C-index 0.63 vs 0.58, resp).

In AML patients older than 60y treated intensively, mutations in 7 genes (NPM1, SRSF2, FLT3, DNMT3A, ASLX1, NRAS and TP53) can refine the prognosis of cytogenetic sub-groups.

c600cb8eb8c36e95c8fe6587b6f16481764896a8,Inflammatory markers in women with postpartum depressive symptoms.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR-per 1 SD increaseÂ =Â 1.20), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (ORÂ =Â 1.17) Interleukin (IL)-18 (ORÂ =Â 1.06), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (ORÂ =Â 1.25), and C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Emma BrÃ¤nn"", ids = ""9553090""); list(name = ""Emma Fransson"", ids = ""8695681""); list(name = ""Richard Aubrey White"", ids = ""49091191""); list(name = ""Fotios C.

For their proper interpretation, we often would like to identify a smaller subset of the variables that shows the strongest information. In such large size of candidate predictors setting, one will encounter a computationally cumbersome search in practice by optimizing some criteria for selecting variables, such as AIC, Cp and BIC, over all possible subsets. Instead of the forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection or Lasso method, we present an efficient algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for searching the optimum value of the corresponding criterion. We will exhibit that our proposed MCMC algorithm obtains better solutions in terms of minimizing those criteria on simulated examples as well as a real data set.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ting-Li Chen"", ids = ""38400310""); list(name = ""Yen-Shiu Chin"", ids = ""103242619"")",,,,,
9a9dbd180171be849a37c29eec12f0a7f72665be,"Chimpanzees with positive welfare are happier, extraverted, and emotionally stable","Facilities housing captive animals are full of staff who, every day, interact with the animals under their care. The expertise and familiarity of staff can be used to monitor animal welfare by means of questionnaires. It was the goal of our study to examine the association between chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) welfare, happiness, and personality. To these ends we collected two waves of welfare and subjective well-being ratings of 18 chimpanzees housed at the Edinburgh Zoo and one set of ratings of 13 chimpanzees housed at Fundacio Mona. Ratings were made on a welfare questionnaire that included 12 items related to stress, psychological stimulation, and behavioural indicators of negative and positive welfare states, and a 4-item subjective well-being questionnaire. In addition, ratings were made on the 54-item Hominoid Personality Questionnaire and an abbreviated version of this scale consisting of 37 antonym pairs. We used generalizability theory to test whether welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. We then assessed the validity of the welfare and subjective well-being questionnaires by examining their associations with behaviour. Finally, we tested whether the welfare and subjective well-being ratings were associated with personality. Welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. Principal components analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis indicated that ten welfare items and all four subjective well-being items formed a single dimension (welfareSWB). LASSO regression found that lower welfareSWB was associated with regurgitation, coprophagy, urophagy, and decreased proximity to nearest neighbour.

26cdc793748e856d85d3ff7672a175c765737a91,CS 224 W Final Report : Community Detection for Distributed Optimization,"Distributed optimization has a large range of applications that make use of massive amounts of data or require limited communication between computing nodes. Therefore, it is important to investigate efficient ways of performing distributed optimization. One of the more popular methods in this area is consensus optimization using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Since a large family of AI and machine learning problems reduces to solving large-scale convex optimization problems, the ADMM algorithm plays a key role in tackling these problems. For example, many supervised learning models under the Empirical Risk Minimization paradigm such as Lasso, Group Lasso, Generalized Linear Model, Logistic Regression, and SVM require minimizing a convex objective function. Running a linear regression on billions of training examples naturally translates to solving a convex problem with billions of terms in the objective function, and applying a distributed method to perform this optimization can considerably reduce the amount of time needed for this task. Moreover, once the scale of the problem becomes too large, solving the problem on a single machine is not even feasible because of memory limitations. In this project, we propose and examine a method to split an arbitrary convex optimization problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved efficiently in a distributed manner using the ADMM algorithm.",2015,,"list(name = ""Tri Dao"", ids = ""24593911"")",,e177365c0dd642341469ba2f045405646c5dbb79; 9af121fbed84c3484ab86df8f17f1f198ed790a0; c8430c5d13834e46631960469d86f7ed4577b0e2; 8c727a90b0d5adcacbce71a84e9aac90263dfde9; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; 4f607f03272e4d62708f5b2441355f9e005cb452; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; 71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 30fca19560538122f42c52cdce315257f9fb7b30; 2e96ac21a424122fb4484b2566ff6efe3251b969; c02dfd94b11933093c797c362e2f8f6a3b9b8012; 2a005868b79511cf8c924cd5990e2497527a0527; b5870f189d666d4d72b420e20eb6dfc39da293bc,,,

991f951428ff00a03c14033d7b22fef17b86fc55,Uniform Consistency of the Highly Adaptive Lasso Estimator of Infinite Dimensional Parameters,"Consider the case that we observe $n$ independent and identically distributed copies of a random variable with a probability distribution known to be an element of a specified statistical model. We are interested in estimating an infinite dimensional target parameter that minimizes the expectation of a specified loss function. In \cite{generally_efficient_TMLE} we defined an estimator that minimizes the empirical risk over all multivariate real valued cadlag functions with variation norm bounded by some constant $M$ in the parameter space, and selects $M$ with cross-validation. We referred to this estimator as the Highly-Adaptive-Lasso estimator due to the fact that the constrained can be formulated as a bound $M$ on the sum of the coefficients a linear combination of a very large number of basis functions. Specifically, in the case that the target parameter is a conditional mean, then it can be implemented with the standard LASSO regression estimator. In \cite{generally_efficient_TMLE} we proved that the HAL-estimator is consistent w.r.t. the (quadratic) loss-based dissimilarity at a rate faster than $n^{-1/2}$ (i.e., faster than $n^{-1/4}$ w.r.t. a norm), even when the parameter space is completely nonparametric. The only assumption required for this rate is that the true parameter function has a finite variation norm. The loss-based dissimilarity is often equivalent with the square of an $L^2(P_0)$-type norm. In this article, we establish that under some weak continuity condition, the HAL-estimator is also uniformly consistent.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mark J. van der Laan"", ids = ""145099512""); list(name = ""Aur'elien F.

The classic methods such as ridge regression, lasso regression, principal component regression are researched to solve the problem above. The ridge regression and principal component regression can not give the clear interpretation features for prediction, and lasso regression does not work well under collinear- ity, also the selections given by lasso regression are unsta- ble and very sensitive to minor perturbations of the data. A practical method based on improved Incremental asso- ciation Markov blanket (IAMB) with Expanded Markov blanket (EMB) was proposed for high-dimensional time series prediction. The EMB was constructed with simulta- neous predictors and past predictors for time series. Since the faithfulness condition and reliable conditional indepen- dence test are not satisfied for high-dimensional time series with limited samples in practical applications. The sym- metry of Markov blanket (MB) and the partial correla- tion coefficient criterion for conditional independent test were employed to learn the EMB, on which the regression was used for prediction.

73b158f26f062ff2fffbc71b56323b669f88481b,Learning Heteroscedastic Models by Convex Programming under Group Sparsity,"Popular sparse estimation methods based on l1-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks--such as time series, random fields, inverse problems--for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure.",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Arnak S.
