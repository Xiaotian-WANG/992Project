ad56e93171297205b86dd5dac5e34bcddca79332,Equivalence between adaptive Lasso and generalized ridge estimators in linear regression with orthogonal explanatory variables after optimizing regularization parameters,"In this paper, we deal with a penalized least-squares (PLS) method for a linear regression model with orthogonal explanatory variables. The used penalties are an adaptive Lasso (AL)-type $$\ell _1$$
 penalty (AL penalty) and a generalized ridge (GR)-type $$\ell _2$$
 penalty (GR penalty). Since the estimators obtained by minimizing the PLS methods strongly depend on the regularization parameters, we optimize them by a model selection criterion (MSC) minimization method. The estimators based on the AL penalty and the GR penalty have different properties, and it is universally recognized that these are completely different estimators. However, in this paper, we show an interesting result that the two estimators are exactly equal when the explanatory variables are orthogonal after optimizing the regularization parameters by the MSC minimization method.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mineaki Ohishi"", ids = ""153891422""); list(name = ""Hirokazu Yanagihara"", ids = ""3215425""); list(name = ""Shuichi Kawano"", ids = ""104013189"")",,45e2d6dbcdba527a4e7e5414cd16e1b32ffedba1; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; b477dd12dd49e44a62c1a303501df5fb6706c7e9; 18bf12962d36b3d24de790bb4c7d7b1e6c2befed; 374c393340e1833ddee7a53dddbca134bcafbe75; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; f0db6fc31357098c575f8f0f2e66e4b1f49f58a5; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 99bde5c9e41596c2440225c78cb9ab64c084acb4; 96cba4bf505af7e06877664348fbbc5fc38adc27; 3ddb61b931fe6949f589b13efb4021ce656f979c; 6e79cd2f1b8f03f4b94cd258659cd758f7d52e51; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; 016eb4fce870dd335084478a4caf2ab74ee12ea2; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 6b5731130ec006df03362e871f5a3c2ce4ab4cf9; e2a1e4613543ae727df8a8a18d78f8a5cebe22da; dc0bfffe4ea55ac40f2547c843a18d1d72b759c6,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics,,1-16

c7871738cefbb716fb59557fd64f38f0b853dfdb,Signature of survival: a 18F-FDG PET based whole-liver radiomic analysis predicts survival after 90Y-TARE for hepatocellular carcinoma,"Purpose
To generate a predictive whole-liver radiomics scoring system for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization using Yttrium-90 (90Y-TARE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).


Results
The generated pPET-RadScores were significantly correlated with survival for PFS (median of 11.4 mo [95% confidence interval CI: 6.3-16.5 mo] in low-risk group [PFS-pPET-RadScore < 0.09] vs. 4.0 mo [95% CI: 2.3-5.7 mo] in high-risk group [PFS-pPET-RadScore > 0.09]; P = 0.0004) and OS (median of 20.3 mo [95% CI: 5.7-35 mo] in low-risk group [OS-pPET-RadScore < 0.11] vs. 7.7 mo [95% CI: 6.0-9.5 mo] in high-risk group [OS-pPET-RadScore > 0.11]; P = 0.007). The multivariate analysis confirmed PFS-pPET-RadScore (P = 0.006) and OS-pPET-RadScore (P = 0.001) as independent negative predictors.


Conclusion
Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET whole-liver radiomics signature appears as an independent negative predictor for PFS and OS in patients undergoing 90Y-TARE for uHCC.


Methods
Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET of 47 consecutive patients undergoing 90Y-TARE for uHCC (31 resin spheres, 16 glass spheres) were retrospectively analyzed. For each patient, based on PET radiomics signature from whole-liver semi-automatic segmentation, PFS and OS predictive PET-radiomics scores (pPET-RadScores) were obtained using LASSO Cox regression. Using X-tile software, the optimal score to predict PFS (PFS-pPET-RadScore) and OS (OS-pPET-RadScore) served as cutoff to separate high and low-risk patients. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic value of PFS and OS-pPET-RadScore, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer staging system and serum alpha-fetoprotein level was analyzed to predict PFS and OS in multivariate analysis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul Blanc-Durand"", ids = ""1404359335""); list(name = ""Axel Van Der Gucht"", ids = ""5467473""); list(name = ""Mario Jreige"", ids = ""8723553""); list(name = ""Marie Nicod-Lalonde"", ids = ""1403193499""); list(name = ""Marina Silva-Monteiro"", ids = ""1417643381""); list(name = ""John O.

Innate immune activation has been implicated generally in pain, opioid analgesia, cognitive dysfunction, and sickness type symptoms reported by cancer patients. We aimed to determine if genetic polymorphisms in neuroimmune activation pathways alter the serum fentanyl concentration-response relationships for pain control, cognitive dysfunction, and other adverse symptoms, in cancer pain patients. Cancer pain patients (468) receiving transdermal fentanyl were genotyped for 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 19 genes: CASP1, BDNF, CRP, LY96, IL6, IL1B, TGFB1, TNF, IL10, IL2, TLR2, TLR4, MYD88, IL6R, OPRM1, ARRB2, COMT, STAT6 and ABCB1. Lasso and backward stepwise generalised linear regression were used to identify non-genetic and genetic predictors, respectively, of pain control (average Brief Pain Inventory < 4), cognitive dysfunction (Mini-Mental State Examination â‰¤ 23), sickness response and opioid adverse event complaint. Serum fentanyl concentrations did not predict between-patient variability in these outcomes, nor did genetic factors predict pain control, sickness response or opioid adverse event complaint. Carriers of the MYD88 rs6853 variant were half as likely to have cognitive dysfunction (11/111) than wild-type patients (69/325), with a relative risk of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.76) when accounting for major non-genetic predictors (age, Karnofsky functional score). This supports the involvement of innate immune signalling in cognitive dysfunction, and identifies MyD88 signalling pathways as a potential focus for predicting and reducing the burden of cognitive dysfunction in cancer pain patients.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Thomas Barratt"", ids = ""5928630""); list(name = ""PÃ¥l Klepstad"", ids = ""3881403""); list(name = ""Ola Dale"", ids = ""40058119""); list(name = ""Stein Kaasa"", ids = ""2373918""); list(name = ""Andrew A Somogyi"", ids = ""40597156"")",8ef47b893e9525b7a2d7629fd289830261a0ee7a; c4f96d287758312cacc090a91557327106878174; 285fc281a5e94525ec993783ff78cbb0767ebfac; 636257b107ff792cfe537f6b26abc623a1e47c89; 65ac832c3b8bb7789b782b703025df0f3990964d; b060accef1124c152cd1d7fe279dcd367ac0fa5a; ec57eb6ba49e148e364dbc00d2a69700cdd3b2d3; d3eea55d85a956eb7738fe26dbb14194c42d5ac6; 41eb077a06d72db4678955099fcb4fefe5bb5f32; a7bc22bcff8cd5dadf2cabc08e8ece24cb5f08df,e5f493c9e9d70465ec64c07d3216475b47db0ce6; 39c4d39cdd3fc5b7afeea5666b5ffc686c6c9a62; 24df12beb81a915e13263d4c5573e159c203b0bb; ac48d27fd897192abc09c22d47a832627c0ecae0; 9c7d8a8c798d2bbcf2fa4478c4b711e9106a4d71; b4f5443c87b65cf5a1acfc5d7869fc119237e862; 884df2ca6e38c476a5be942b7cdf6e335f0354df; 5012ca387b2b4beaa4eacd10ca73f02c34b4fd5e; e939171fcefb6dc79c79f5ce71944ac1573d7ea1; 376d692e22c7425f7e72a223fc5737d0db907bef; 85260435ef61e3df0e229d6675002e106939791e; 2670d89a5baf447095db371272446dddaad2a6c5; 1db1e9463d92a1e7ace5a502bb3ab9676e1968f1; f34807ee86cd56f89a016d8f76b1072afbde5161; 037f0bef427514fca66eae703f4638095d7ca9ed; 678f47a33ee0f7b1652519ef6c2997d69ddd41fe; f68694272773b3d94d573c437f035590d0cc122a; 21ca8f0b4b8f0859d4082efeeb59417a750cbf03; 9ed47e209604a4bfb198f7db649f1af21d48c0b1; 631a7b3d2e457ba183437e40ca98055b86ac4f7b; e2ad7aca045ddb4d4ae2ca0f54fc6e82d4ccdd70; e2026a208395895794bfb8e83aa915f10834460a; 6499e5f4152ac0200b7dac89dd71b23097ecb8a7; f6e60e2d1d4f813080877c95cb3b06d7af6b6d5f; 28823016324f6eac0c30fe38d11c4ba214740320; 95529d226c6ea7bed18a57bd94f0ef8afbb8c38e; 3d24e1987e31ce590d0148a8e7da428e97de9c54; 5c066eca1f65ec6ab84f04b5e2b76be97dbd5d2c; 42b3b7235d2359ddf4852a0eb4e27a3c59f9563f; 5ad5e9762ccac381d192801abf1b11c604cf066d; 6c86b08ad1d7736eddbbb98e0c79200f8f6e0a0a; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; c5adae8fe1630ec8a9fbc16e9a75c0ef7bf6fdbf; 0b485413633fecfb2073f6ec4bf4d4777b3cb4c0; c994e6bb8ff487add93834222a2ad6acef1a5d4d; 526d2c1decef2f281dde8e49da6d9583b01e7d23; e4ba09cb3f719bfad5b8e47c8fd8a1529fa85d1d; acb32fa304b5554eb83f567b571f5684c0ef7f2e; 079e7e94b58872b4baf92663b0960ba2a99a883e; 7976c232c997caeb00dbeb4e75d589d960a4a0fa; e869be9b5664db6b67a4fd9899f785f498e25407; 9ee1e9ea9eb5346a2be3d8fec8ecaa8b3c8d23ab,PLoS ONE,10,
da9007fc403826918e22f3bfa17d931064a97535,Decentralised Sparse Multi-Task Regression.,"We consider a sparse multi-task regression framework for fitting a collection of related sparse models. Representing models as nodes in a graph with edges between related models, a framework that fuses lasso regressions with the total variation penalty is investigated. Under a form of restricted eigenvalue assumption, bounds on prediction and squared error are given that depend upon the sparsity of each model and the differences between related models. This assumption relates to the smallest eigenvalue restricted to the intersection of two cone sets of the covariance matrix constructed from each of the agents' covariances. We show that this assumption can be satisfied if the constructed covariance matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property. In the case of a grid topology high-probability bounds are given that match, up to log factors, the no-communication setting of fitting a lasso on each model, divided by the number of agents.

d629062b0d2282b90e6ade043a94397ffb2410c4,Assessing the Driverâ€™s Current Level of Working Memory Load with High Density Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy: A Realistic Driving Simulator Study,"Cognitive overload or underload results in a decrease in human performance which may result in fatal incidents while driving. We envision that driver assistive systems which adapt their functionality to the driver's cognitive state could be a promising approach to reduce road accidents due to human errors. This research attempts to predict variations of cognitive working memory load levels in a natural driving scenario with multiple parallel tasks and to reveal predictive brain areas. We used a modified version of the n-back task to induce five different working memory load levels (from 0-back up to 4-back) forcing the participants to continuously update, memorize, and recall the previous 'n' speed sequences and adjust their speed accordingly while they drove for approximately 60 min on a highway with concurrent traffic in a virtual reality driving simulator. We measured brain activation using multichannel whole head, high density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and predicted working memory load level from the fNIRS data by combining multivariate lasso regression and cross-validation. This allowed us to predict variations in working memory load in a continuous time-resolved manner with mean Pearson correlations between induced and predicted working memory load over 15 participants of 0.61 [standard error (SE) 0.04] and a maximum of 0.8. Restricting the analysis to prefrontal sensors placed over the forehead reduced the mean correlation to 0.38 (SE 0.04), indicating additional information gained through whole head coverage. Moreover, working memory load predictions derived from peripheral heart rate parameters achieved much lower correlations (mean 0.21, SE 0.1). Importantly, whole head fNIRS sampling revealed increasing brain activation in bilateral inferior frontal and bilateral temporo-occipital brain areas with increasing working memory load levels suggesting that these areas are specifically involved in workload-related processing.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anirudh Unni"", ids = ""34722642""); list(name = ""Klas Ihme"", ids = ""2873465""); list(name = ""Meike Jipp"", ids = ""50093361""); list(name = ""Jochem W.

134be6bb940825682c54477eea1a1023d83c852b,Subsampling Winner Algorithm for Feature Selection in Large Regression Data,"Feature selection from a large number of covariates (aka features) in a regression analysis remains a challenge in data science, especially in terms of its potential of scaling to ever-enlarging data and finding a group of scientifically meaningful features. For example, to develop new, responsive drug targets for ovarian cancer, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) of a practical feature selection procedure must also match the target FDR. The popular approach to feature selection, when true features are sparse, is to use a penalized likelihood or a shrinkage estimation, such as a LASSO, SCAD, Elastic Net, or MCP procedure (call them benchmark procedures). We present a different approach using a new subsampling method, called the Subsampling Winner algorithm (SWA). The central idea of SWA is analogous to that used for the selection of US national merit scholars. SWA uses a ""base procedure"" to analyze each of the subsamples, computes the scores of all features according to the performance of each feature from all subsample analyses, obtains the ""semifinalist"" based on the resulting scores, and then determines the ""finalists,"" i.e., the most important features. Due to its subsampling nature, SWA can scale to data of any dimension in principle. The SWA also has the best-controlled actual FDR in comparison with the benchmark procedures and the randomForest, while having a competitive true-feature discovery rate. We also suggest practical add-on strategies to SWA with or without a penalized benchmark procedure to further assure the chance of ""true"" discovery. Our application of SWA to the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens from the Broad Institute revealed functionally important genes and pathways, which we verified by additional genomics tools. This second-stage investigation is essential in the current discussion of the proper use of P-values.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yiying Fan"", ids = ""11314825""); list(name = ""Jiayang Sun"", ids = ""34387941"")",,cd83d7cb482d8ca3a6cd02d620ea903caa5094c1; 8dc6179861acca80fc8f76efeabbce73c81c8cfb; f89be3aa29635b1e7f6c8bb40d9aa81acaf41fa5; 8e30f02d667163ff52223efd57c0b48a0a9a7873; d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; 3f30d735a0883dfacd7cde977071adb3f47a2e8b; eecbb6deedb9f4b09477fd18092d5d89de3e9c42; 4d19272112b50547614479a0c409fca66e3b05f7; 109974f8eee235de94ed270a1cc4bb3deff6d78c; 9989a698cd22a880246afd960187860303e9ca5e; 347766a669066db4bfdaaa52ec63994e49046d49; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 4057c911fa0a6b64e1cf47d7af213f07bcb4ae36; 99649284503c2abe6871ae45f3dbf394a3a86352; 031253e71c99fcc8229bbdb55272e91f8f673ef7; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b3aafecf3b609eacc58708be7e4690cd225d2c92; 3f5f4acbfb67424fa7c952f8986f0e3dd70d47af; c1cfa98358911c211b4f291140929f529df869fd; 861545be40e6c726d5c24ab0f17ccc6370a4c78c; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 3f37d8b8ceb959499a3321a9e8c6abbade16f34e; b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609; 6f0ba62fb7f55cd9c17322d738afd43bb58ff869; f95f7fa27a4ff248f57e22164a567d75e03ac46b; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 44ad920f1d046adb042ea6a33d4b216f2d76ba81; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82; b1b8b7345ea65aea64758fd4b0dfa20ed04663f2; 3e9a1daf09d089dd365142291ac8e4d68d4afb6b; 3ce59d56f36dd164185e554a0666719a578bb3b5; b7f2de0bf6c2be761c2f266571dccd5d5d9aac90,ArXiv,abs/2002.02903,
4cefd3bf10627dab35fa16cf1ff4562c382f0df2,"Structured Input-Output Lasso, with Application to eQTL Mapping, and a Thresholding Algorithm for Fast Estimation","We consider the problem of learning a high-dimensional multi-task regression model, under sparsity constraints induced by presence of grouping structures on the input covariates and on the output predictors. This problem is primarily motivated by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, of which the goal is to discover genetic variations in the genome (inputs) that influence the expression levels of multiple co-expressed genes (outputs), either epistatically, or pleiotropically, or both. A structured input-output lasso (SIOL) model based on an intricate l1/l2-norm penalty over the regression coefficient matrix is employed to enable discovery of complex sparse input/output relationships; and a highly efficient new optimization algorithm called hierarchical group thresholding (HiGT) is developed to solve the resultant non-differentiable, non-separable, and ultra high-dimensional optimization problem. We show on both simulation and on a yeast eQTL dataset that our model leads to significantly better recovery of the structured sparse relationships between the inputs and the outputs, and our algorithm significantly outperforms other optimization techniques under the same model. Additionally, we propose a novel approach for efficiently and effectively detecting input interactions by exploiting the prior knowledge available from biological experiments.",2012,Computer Science; Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""Seunghak Lee"", ids = ""1918078""); list(name = ""Eric P.

4298f471916bfaea7391129efce4e25cc9dc0d95,Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk in Hemodialysis: a Challenging Healthcare and Machine Learning Problem,"End stage renal disease (ESRD) condition increases the risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and sudden death; mortality rates among hemodialysis patients are 20% higher than the general population. Thus in recent years the understanding and proper management of the determinants of cardiovascular disease have become a major focus of nephrology care in order to prevent sudden cardiovascular events (CVEs). 
Aim of this study is to develop forecast models able to predict cardiovascular outcome of patients incidenting (i.e. starting) hemodialysis (HD) treatment. 
Data used in this study was collected in Fresenius Medical Care clinics through the Clinical Management System EuCliD, a system used to handle hemodialysis processes and related information in 626 clinics belonging to 25 countries all over the world since 1999. Data relating to the treatment methods and the physiological condition of patients was collected during the first 12 months of renal replacement therapy and then used to predict the insurgence of CVEs within a 6-month time window. Information regarding 4246 incident hemodialysis patients was extracted and processed. 39 physiological and treatment features were extracted from the temporal series of the variables of interest and used to train predictive models. 
A non-linear Random Forest (RF) predictive model was developed and compared to a Lasso logistic regression model and to a linear kernel SVM model. Every forecast model was tested on 20% of the data. 5-fold cross validation approach was used to validate SVM and RF models. For every patient an estimated probability of having a cardiovascular event was extracted from the random forest with an innovative approach. Every patient was classified in each tree as belonging to the cardiovascular group (patients having a CVE in the next temporal window) or as belonging to the control group (patients not having a cardiovascular event in the next 6 months) and for each patient the mean of the trees votes was used as a probability estimate of cardiovascular risk. ROC curves were built on the probability values obtained using RF model as well as on probability values obtained using linear SVM and logistic regression models. 
Random forest showed higher performance in terms of AUC and ROC values than the other models and sensitivity higher than 73% proving that random forests are able to exploit non-linear patterns retrieved in the feature space. To our knowledge, RF classifier showed a better performance than any other classifier used in previous works in literature for CV risk stratification in ESRD incident patients. 
Moreover out of bag estimates of variable importance in RF and regression coefficients were used to gain insight into the implemented models. It turns out that malnutrition and an inflammatory condition strongly influence cardiovascular outcome in incident HD patients. The results are encouraging and of high importance in nephrology, since a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the insurgence of cardiovascular events in HD patients can ensure physicians to promptly intervene to prevent a worsening of CV condition.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jasmine Ion Titapiccolo"", ids = ""3325663""); list(name = ""Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano Dipartimento di Elettronica"", ids = ""118374387""); list(name = ""Manuela Ferrario"", ids = ""2166600""); list(name = ""Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano Dipartimento di Elettronica"", ids = ""118374387""); list(name = ""Carlo Barbieri"", ids = ""2887249""); list(name = ""Flavio Mari"", ids = ""2451217""); list(name = ""Emanuele Gatti"", ids = ""2270257""); list(name = ""Sergio Cerutti"", ids = ""22010550""); list(name = ""Maria Gabriella Signorini"", ids = ""35081230"")",,,,,
3a9af97d5ae26a5a901dca4d7d55e2bde8808cf0,Note for Alan â€™ s Class,"Wavelets have proven to be immensely useful for signal analysis and representation [7]. Various dictionaries of wavelets have been designed for different types of signals or function spaces [3, 13]. Two key factors underlying the successes of wavelets are the sparsity of the representation and the efficiency of the analysis. Specifically, a signal can typically be represented by a linear superposition of a small number of wavelet elements selected from an appropriate dictionary. The selection can be accomplished by efficient algorithms such as matching pursuit [10] and basis pursuit [4]. From a linear regression perspective, a signal can be considered a response variable, and the wavelet elements in the dictionary can be considered the predictor variables or regressors. The number of elements in a dictionary can often be much greater than the dimensionality of the signal, so this is the so-called â€œp > nâ€ problem. The selection of the wavelet elements is the variable selection problem in linear regression. The matching pursuit algorithm [10] is the forward selection method, and the basis pursuit [4] is the lasso method [14].",2009,,"list(name = ""Zhangzhang Si"", ids = ""1807123""); list(name = ""Haifeng Gong"", ids = ""1760137""); list(name = ""Song-Chun Zhu"", ids = ""145380991""); list(name = ""Ying Nian Wu"", ids = ""39092098"")",,714f9ded3adcb8c20d4ca18d7ff87f95453cb05b; 9af121fbed84c3484ab86df8f17f1f198ed790a0; 2a8f91e023757d228743cd55836cae527fd3d78f; ca1d23be869380ac9e900578c601c2d1febcc0c9; 02f89cd1fd6f013a1a301a292936ff8fb06aff25; 8012c4a1e2ca663f1a04e80cbb19631a00cbab27; 8515604037444b3f079a9d328b0c560f33da0a19; 85abadb689897997f1e37baa7b5fc6f7d497518b; 8d78e51e0ec553aad5e5884c83ce7429312ea47e; 9f7a116df0815c85dd18b73a8ce68b0b9d147c4e; 1b7ffae8feb4d5ec9f2bf396f355ca0fdbfb64c6; 0843c2f5cbd7dda30cbeed73d95b77d068408476; cce218b91cf634413ef9a71f702bd37b1a9ad2a6; da24b177742501c26f0355ffffc01ce18c10f054; ff45297a6643f88389e8993229b1c27dfed93768; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,,,
da176ca6c5e6ab5816365d0c6fc2d5353f3ce61a,Sleep quality and nocturnal pain in patients with femoroacetabular impingement and acetabular dysplasia,"Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome and acetabular dysplasia (AD) are common pathologies that lead to pain in the young adult hip. Nocturnal pain in these patients is often reported, yet little is known regarding the effect of these hip pathologies on overall sleep quality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep quality in patients with AD and FAI syndrome. This cross-sectional study consisted of 115 patients who complained of hip pain secondary to either FAI syndrome or AD. One hundred fifteen patients with hip pain secondary to FAI syndrome and AD were assessed using the Hip Outcome Score (HOS), Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and then Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Multiple linear regression, with adaptive LASSO variable selection, was used to assess factors associated with sleep quality. Of the 115 patients, 62 had a diagnosis of FAI syndrome and 53 with AD. The mean age was 34.55â€‰Â±â€‰11.66 (age range: 14 to 58â€‰years), 76.52% had an ASA classification of 1 (ASA range: 1 to 3), and all Tonnis grades were either 0 or 1. The mean PSQI global score for all patients was 8.46â€‰Â±â€‰4.35 (PSQI range: 0 to 21), indicating poor sleep quality. The adaptive LASSO-penalized least squares multiple linear regression revealed that HOOS Pain, SF-12 Role Emotional, and SF-12 Mental Health significantly predicted Sleep Quality (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.4041). Sleep quality improved as pain, emotional problems, and mental health improved. Patients with symptomatic FAI syndrome and AD have poor sleep quality. Worsening pain from a patientâ€™s hip pathology is associated with poor sleep, even prior to the onset of osteoarthrosis of the hip. Patients presenting with hip pain from FAI syndrome and AD should be screened for sleep disturbance and may benefit from a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""N Avinash Reddy"", ids = ""1381046941""); list(name = ""J Riley Martinez"", ids = ""151056367""); list(name = ""Edward P.

6d714092fbe98f3277de2d0ff88078aab5833c52,Characteristics and associated factors of physical activity-related injuries among university students in southern China,"This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the characteristics of physical activity-related injury (PARI) and to explore its associated factors among university students in Chaoshan district. Selected from the baseline survey in March and April, 434 students graded 1â€“3 from two universities were interviewed face-to-face in April and May 2017. Socio-demographics, physical activity (PA) participation, risk-taking behaviors, and PARI occurrences in the past 12 months were collected. Group Lasso logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors of PARI. Totally, 317 PARI episodes were reported by 184 subjects with an overall injury risk of 0.73 injuries/student/year (males: 1.00, females: 0.63) and an injury incidence density of 0.81 injuries per 1000 PA exposure hours (males: 1.13, females: 0.69). Most injuries involved the lower extremities and were sprains and strains.

Pulmonary aspiration syndrome is the principal cause of ARDS and nosocomial pneumonia, which increase hospital morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Previous attempts to identify the risk factors for overt nosocomial aspiration were not systematic. OBJECTIVES. To derive and validate comprehensive prediction model for overt nosocomial pulmonary aspiration. We hypothesized that such prediction model will show adequate discrimination and calibration in historical patient cohorts. METHODS. A retrospective case-control study of consecutive adults admitted to Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, MN from 2006 through 2015. Nosocomial aspiration was defined using a novel electronic medical record-based diagnostic algorithm (termed â€œaspiration snifferâ€) based on natural language processing of clinical notes. The patients who screened positive for aspiration and who were either in the ICU within 48 hours before aspiration or required ICU care within 48 hours after aspiration, were enrolled and split into the derivation and the validation cohorts. An equal number of controls were selected from among those who screened negative for aspiration, matching for age, sex, and year of hospitalization. A blinded manual chart review was performed on a random sample to assess the sniffer's accuracy for aspiration/non-aspiration. Predictor variables included a comprehensive list of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, prognostic scores (Charlson, SOFA, APACHE), and clinical variables (all present or have occurred before aspiration). We performed LASSO regression analysis to select the variables for the model. All variables with P< 0.15 contributed to the final multivariable conditional logistic regression model. The model's discrimination was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS. Out of 45,115 patients, 917 fulfilled the aspiration enrollment criteria and after adding matched controls were split into the derivation (458 pairs) and validation (459 pairs) datasets. The random-sample manual chart review showed 100% accuracy of the sniffer-based aspiration/non-aspiration assignment. Variables selected for the final model are presented in Table 1. This aspiration prediction model showed very good discrimination. The concordance statistic using the point score for the derivation and validation models were 0.777 (95% CI 0.74, 0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.74, 0.82). Using the best discrimination cutoff of 4.5, sensitivity and specificity were 71.2/72.3 and 72.5/69.9 in the derivation/validation models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. We derived and validated electronic prediction model for overt nosocomial pulmonary aspiration, programmable for automated identification of hospitalized patients' at risk, in whom potential prevention strategies can be developed and tested.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emir FestiÄ‡"", ids = ""152478124""); list(name = ""Vikas Bansal"", ids = ""49549970""); list(name = ""Mariyam Zuberi"", ids = ""50181565""); list(name = ""R.

This thesis proposes elastic net regularization logistic regression as a good candidate of data analytic method for Event-Related Potential analysis (ERP). Specifically, regularization techniques are used to identify latency in ERP. Study 1 tested whether regularization logistic regression can classify latency using simulated ERP data. It showed that ridge and lasso could identify latency information. In study 2, the same analyses were applied to actual ERP data.

9ef09d18fc6d86fc308a73c555b7217cf80ccfaf,First order expansion of convex regularized estimators,"We consider first order expansions of convex penalized estimators in high-dimensional regression problems with random designs. Our setting includes linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. For a given penalty function $h$ and the corresponding penalized estimator $\hbeta$, we construct a quantity $\eta$, the first order expansion of $\hbeta$, such that the distance between $\hbeta$ and $\eta$ is an order of magnitude smaller than the estimation error $\|\hat{\beta} - \beta^*\|$. In this sense, the first order expansion $\eta$ can be thought of as a generalization of influence functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized estimators in high-dimensions. Such first order expansion implies that the risk of $\hat{\beta}$ is asymptotically the same as the risk of $\eta$ which leads to a precise characterization of the MSE of $\hbeta$; this characterization takes a particularly simple form for isotropic design. Such first order expansion also leads to inference results based on $\hat{\beta}$. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized form, and the Group-Lasso. The results apply to general loss functions under some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in linear regression and for the logistic loss in the logistic model.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pierre C.

Although great efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis and development of ES, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify new key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, targeted therapy or prognosis of ES. mRNA expression profile chip data sets GSE17674, GSE17679 and GSE45544 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the R software limma package, and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the enrichplot package and GSEA software. The NetworkAnalyst online tool, as well as Cytoscape and its plug-ins cytoHubba and NetworkAnalyzer, were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and conduct module analysis to screen key (hub) genes. LABSO COX regression and overall survival (OS) analysis of the Hub genes were performed. A total of 211 DEGs were obtained by integrating and analyzing the three data sets. The functions and pathways of the DEGs were mainly associated with the regulation of small-molecule metabolic processes, cofactor-binding, amino acid, proteasome and ribosome biosynthesis in eukaryotes, as well as the Rac1, cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. A total of one important module and 20 hub genes were screened from the PPI network using the Maximum Correlation Criteria algorithm of cytoHubba. LASSO COX regression results revealed that titin (TTN), fast skeletal muscle troponin T, skeletal muscle actin Î±-actin, nebulin, troponin C type 2 (fast), myosin light-chain 3 (MYL3), slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1), myosin-binding protein C1 slow-type, tropomyosin 3 and myosin heavy-chain 7 were associated with prognosis in patients with ES. The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that high mRNA expression levels of TNNT1 (P<0.001), TTN (P=0.049), titin-cap (P=0.04), tropomodulin 1 (P=0.011), troponin I2 fast skeletal type (P=0.021) and MYL3 (P=0.017) were associated with poor OS in patients with ES.

It has many desirable theoretical properties and has been shown to be effective in various applications. However, under the condition of a large-scale dataset, learning the sparse sample affinity graph is computationally expensive. To tackle the computation time cost challenge, we develop a memory-efficient parallel framework for computing SSC via an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed framework partitions the data matrix into column blocks and then decomposes the original problem into parallel multivariate Lasso regression subproblems and samplewise operations. The proposed method allows us to allocate multiple cores/machines for the processing of individual column blocks. We propose a stochastic optimization algorithm to minimize the objective function.

192afc74f853d2fd11b0fa2443c235c21a8f2078,A systematic comparison of statistical methods to detect interactions in exposome-health associations,"BackgroundThere is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions.MethodsSimulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate.ResultsGLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects.ConclusionsGLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose Barrera-GÃ³mez"", ids = ""1401743323""); list(name = ""Lydiane Agier"", ids = ""50477938""); list(name = ""LÃ¼tzen Portengen"", ids = ""3681601""); list(name = ""Marc Chadeau-Hyam"", ids = ""1380692828""); list(name = ""Lise Giorgis-Allemand"", ids = ""1399386793""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie Siroux"", ids = ""4475234""); list(name = ""Oliver Robinson"", ids = ""144538171""); list(name = ""Jelle Vlaanderen"", ids = ""144164836""); list(name = ""Juan JosÃ© Ramos GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""1802926""); list(name = ""Mark J Nieuwenhuijsen"", ids = ""6741164""); list(name = ""Paolo Vineis"", ids = ""2591675""); list(name = ""Martine Vrijheid"", ids = ""3658758""); list(name = ""Roel C H Vermeulen"", ids = ""144756664""); list(name = ""RÃ©my Slama"", ids = ""34893849""); list(name = ""Xavier BasagaÃ±a"", ids = ""5944461"")",799a2e47eaf83ac84c063ae247c6e4afd02a038a; 6d11ec4eebf32f05e1bcfa12de2fb51012ef35e1; be9c3b5cd0ed78f04746918e3d8b5110de2bf79e; 0ca315ae6c63d7b3601d1e8f7f84f497030c6f0d; c510a0f293fb449440eb091c5d0faee6c868a933; 68929dab8eb53f167f3fd9aa55653565360832fc; 373798ba190c80b4f1bb4915c297310e12556c27; 4efb5ee690dfbd54b8e8e36dc91bc67e208f5a05; 372a76129de608181bea22bdb37ceaa372345949,779f296ff11bf8cd37805fab8368801c7204fd3c; 5d71ec68c63f52026a28727b6677e5965bb04bb1; 5e4698cd7acb8eb17e7234e3aa617c2cbee858a3; baaaa3e20ca4ba8dae31218ae7a9382253b83b50; 02c388d43f619146ef64babb4c848190e83add1b; 4f830f55abc04c1ef832ec9f90f19f0425f71fd9; fe4eb71f3f60a417c4a95395fc1cf56dc8fee72d; 8a9b3bc63ee9d0af9d494e0a574e65c4c2f323eb; 60dad118e7cbc7df62dd8cf631efba93d01e5b52; b744f51e887f9841c049d333a84d8f0e09b43a8b; 7f89ade32cf3fcd079184fa45c6d2a13906d2c27; 48a75b84f2d314ab5a8f4e76fac2b77d44492dfc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ec55fde909b592f92ae85c308dff5c695c5c22ea; bca0db1f8f75891a1ec302ab0252439ef92c38ea; 26b2a185c68f55e90720276dda5337cae3953b09; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; e882e78f633a876bea4ad490181471d391d54c86; bace0cc082a2dd1ece949be7e07393b5e6bd6b9e; 86ae37eb0c2d809105471960876d9140eb8f7a50; d0653e0c29dfa6122e7aaf3520b0edd3ecc23e1e; 4ab5ebadee2ee7a4a253682ceb6e1d71ca5c2efc; 3ec729f943f530b3aa591e38c3d96c75a5261397; 0e96748051783bcc2d9bb7fa460286b46d7d80a5; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a83e529d5350e39d5b53cad4e1217317524c2bc5; 6ba9afd9241a5d04e2ce890f0a6f082d167968b8; e3456adb2403d3f478aad2144e5e317da68321b9,Environmental Health,16,

These penalties quantify the relative position of rows of the coefficient matrix from a fixed distribution centered at the origin. We derive the theoretical properties of an approximate one-step sparse estimator of the coefficient matrix using local linear approximation of the penalty function, and provide algorithm for its computation. For orthogonal design and independent responses, the resulting thresholding rule enjoys near-minimax optimal risk performance, similar to the adaptive lasso (Zou, 2006).

In principle, sisVIVE is robust to some of the IVs in the analysis being invalid, in the sense of being related to the outcome variable through pathways not mediated by the exposure. In this paper, we consider the application of sisVIVE to a Mendelian randomization study in which multiple genetic variants are used as IVs to estimate the causal effect of body mass index on personal income in the presence of unobserved confounding. In addition to analyzing data from the large-scale longitudinal household survey Understanding Society, we conduct a simulation study to (a) assess the performance of sisVIVE in relation to that of competing robust methods like ""MR-Egger"" and ""MR-Median"" and (b) identify scenarios under which its absolute performance is poor. We find that sisVIVE outperforms alternative robust methods, in terms of mean-square error, across a wide range of scenarios, but that its performance is poor in absolute terms when the presence of indirect pleiotropy leads to failure of the ""InSIDE"" condition, which is not explicitly required for identification. We argue that this is because the consistency criterion for sisVIVE does not identify the true causal effect when InSIDE fails.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanchun Bao"", ids = ""39406407""); list(name = ""Paul S Clarke"", ids = ""144640604""); list(name = ""Melissa C.

Methods and materials: Sixty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer treated by IMRT from 2008 to 2011 were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 56 months. According to the criteria of D'Amico risk classifications, there were 9, 20 and 39 patients in low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. Forty-two patients were combined with androgen deprivation therapy. Fifteen patients had suffered from grade 2 or more (grade 2+) late rectal bleeding. The numbers of predictors for a multivariable logistic regression NTCP model were determined by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Results: The most important predictors for late rectal bleeding ranked by LASSO were platelet count, risk group and the relative volume of rectum receiving at least 65 Gy (V65). The NTCP model of grade 2+ rectal bleeding was as follows: S = -17.49 + Platelets (1000/Î¼L) * (-0.025) + Risk group * Corresponding coefficient (low-risk group = 0; intermediate-risk group = 19.07; high-risk group = 20.41) + V65 * 0.045. Conclusions: A LASSO-based multivariable NTCP model comprising three important predictors (platelet count, risk group and V65) was established to predict the incidence of grade 2+ late rectal bleeding after IMRT.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chun-chieh Huang"", ids = ""50419080""); list(name = ""Pei-Ju Chao"", ids = ""5352745""); list(name = ""Shih-Sian Guo"", ids = ""5256289""); list(name = ""Chong-Jong Wang"", ids = ""152745025""); list(name = ""Hao-Lun Luo"", ids = ""47030271""); list(name = ""Yu-Li Su"", ids = ""3211399""); list(name = ""Tsair-Fwu Lee"", ids = ""1771310""); list(name = ""Fu-Min Fang"", ids = ""1875711"")",,72dee8e215dbef49a275f74348314f31bd5ae359; 0e83b0680f3067a0fd8b9a367edd39c9b28ce61c; 713a631f8f988b2a0dfd4eca014f93e7827189f7; 8b099a5b214f325bd0fc941e434b1ab3bcc04399; ccefbf368a43f64c07f97939b66715a7058cdca7; 13175d0e8ad2e4ee197a1bf37064937fd4f9c595; 2bd0cbe71547bce8dadac6275d28618dd5cd5091; 71a7152cac738570d19dbaa75465f3b90acd3220; 0e08e732553011ae741ee94470832bdf5e70e615; 0235c9eb1b8271c8ef80c52168e5329a2ff90eb2; 3c7625c4b82306d4523ce458cd632c4a5bb13a99; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ac0f6ec1d009f8d6673479b398541f3a0dda6fca; 5020b5f1c986e3cb82ececc3a7941e5b685f0ec2; 7ecc5f6fb9a806459f44e7c6584562bc70734295; d5c8b943655a7f60b759ff240a3da390cd54cc3a; 64e335a1d4603aa53ab8121c4e86c8cc4629ce98; 8dbc78c1ff1742643f32c9b4d37e64b494fb719a; 9227723a7e34c6bada59ddc5161a18412358a6e6; 0783977c371eb8915a8f8211980551d7e6a3cd98; 15c87394066ccae7f95ebe6d79ce0759a706c991; f141ff599733f2c94e4875294b541be4b1b0c48f; beeb0851b9c2cae8e22de93fea7646231e2a30e5; 14cdb02018de3876b1b306dbe56e8fa4ebc2f851; 92b69105a8af4ca63c6d2b7ef75456938760ddaf; 147de7a4d9a688c57c818a62d2ac5ff7a0fb9563; c121bb0a680dc632ff98bb7972b09ddb394516d5; de9f5baf5bae52f079f20c69376f359ca50046e5; b253da1fa544aed534bd8abea993358f0bbe5831; 95867aa02d07065fa5083aa28bb5432022838dd0; 2451c3f75bd0eb9000d1b190c3d72dadda704337,Journal of Cancer,10,2588 - 2593

Therefore, it is urgent to find predictive biomarkers that can accurately identify MIBC patients who are sensitive to ICIs. In this study, we computed the relative abundances of 24 immune cells based on the expression profiles of MIBC patients using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the 24 immune cells was performed to classify MIBC patients into different immune-infiltrating groups. Genome (gene mutation and copy number variation), transcriptome (mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA), and functional enrichment were found to be heterogeneous among different immune-infiltrating groups. We identified 282 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with immune infiltration by comparing the expression profiles of patients with different immune infiltration profiles, and 20 core prognostic DEGs were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis. An immune-relevant gene signature (TIM signature) consisting of nine key prognostic DEGs (CCDC80, CD3D, CIITA, FN1, GBP4, GNLY, SPINK1, UBD, and VIM) was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and subgroup analysis confirmed that the TIM signature was an ideal biomarker for predicting the prognosis of MIBC patients. Its value in predicting immunotherapeutic responses was also validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (AUCÂ =Â 0.69, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.63-0.74) and the IMvigor210 cohort (AUCÂ =Â 0.64, 95%Â =Â 0.55-0.74). The TIM signature demonstrates a powerful ability to distinguish MIBC patients with different prognoses and immunotherapeutic responses, but more prospective studies are needed to assess its reliability in the future.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen Jiang"", ids = ""143845033""); list(name = ""Dandan Zhu"", ids = ""40665624""); list(name = ""Chenghe Wang"", ids = ""3417708""); list(name = ""Yu Zhu"", ids = ""1481711948"")",,1203db6b41694ad2c5ebef1ebdf043f648f79af7; 5d36f01ae3441689cef50d0a5f86b801fa0b2fe5; 28a6a69125f826864770c0a1e0e6e33581deabf1; de78d1c114c15fb66f079a90b6fec3fb3705b462; f76965af80bc48043a85319feb94e8e95540a575; 67c6acd2471c8bf27c67005975748b3f28d91bf8; 7cad6bedf34432e909a59ef806a7edd5a8a8149e; a8ecbe5a7368d29a541188f176edfe06ce38517b; d8c83be9fd25c11c6c19a10b820f9ac61adf9de7; d15b46b3145c39f89c96b72cd641e3b628322cda; 2bd0c5cd32ba4e954e863ad72cd5c00c90fc7ec0; fd20fd13191304413af18300c72deefaa7084589; aca6b02721641c9ffc22cf34c44a493c836cd0f5; 5143365465d2d9435815fea574fc4b68b10d6d96; 4046b22cdf4b179dd3753d4cf246c99f8ea8ba18; 65989052b77039c510e8487341cc6dc573c2b998; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; c42a2c23b11f2baa8a72842e1a6d1386f45ea00b; 79930e6b48c9d2c54c14d54238f65aac0cd1343d; 196d74e5d6df7897cda24564580853af5887b7a4; 649313708f6e74e63d1cdf6bd85dfa8d8e1d7da4; b16a17ad16572d8f584294d87c94c50af3eca4eb; 6613500dd0ab86f1b9577d9c1373c5084de31461; 739c55e4a52ee5ee7ab5ec19604a19559224b441; 263ad7aafbc3818f6e022efb1dea7c33e8834c75; b9c77a9b22ea6faa2bf1a732de1d84ca39addc77; 282950d8fd6fbee7b80421ff48c5d20c7af9925f; 7c9286ab81d87007f70820b9b3400540d6f2f738; 8bc829d3357a9c77819ff565ece25d060f09a865; d431214508a87c00021712350a6646103a82d4e0; 8607a8b0cb257e47cb706472420e2de7a546bff0; 232406e0bc86171b8784de7817caed978e23a616; 9a12e0d5bacb65141864be2b007d696594763429; 6c45c192fcadc7cc13cc006432122b26895b2054; 9fc2da210d9e94ae90de76e1a5ae4f7f675303ee; 8714eb652f091050a6805eec8d1132cb6ec7a36a; 2da39aa2ca1ff9df5fd4afe5c69d8ef2b8c48b88; da5af374490f66c208b3cd3c3e86a3adf7123d93; 3a080c4720cad5e24efe44a682173c78f735fae3; 815f5280fa3c080533f1bfd7891268e61efb5bff; 1fff57c0e0bf903dc1c5ef1b583bf564a61b32e3; 632fae5bc2f9afe087fc116c410468cd3e876ecd; db2ffc3647f801d57b5d661d7f77736461f7203f; a9fd3dd15a9b65eb1e8b31f4a519c80d9129904c; 7a26221b8298e15e19b3f9719cbcd66c0e9e57e2; faebcb8ccf27d5dfb459b6ede559b7fad5f2bc45; 62952fcf683d08ae3da915b5a6bd6fe96fcea8ab; d1daaadcb4ebc0dace6fcd8ca7decb4573443d17; 3af045503abf81705fc1833aadf5db93a9be854c; 2964d3fdf35964c78322bab723317d4935b5ae65; ce4e12123b41759caae7e7d2b14005b64cd4dc4b; 6dc3eb01e071e6e68a4d343536b662cebba583d4; 3d3609aa1c279a27b657509813c7a140ecdf44d0; 06febcc524a27ed35cf8040fefe6ed9dcb4d9410; 795deef4e48465fb4612e421712bc894c32870b8,Cancer Medicine,9,2774 - 2790

9ca5d318c1468e05d0ecd1dbe0274653294823f5,Feature Selection Bias in Assessing the Predictivity of SNPs for Alzheimer's Disease,"In the context of identifying related SNPs for a phenotype of interest (e.g., a disease status), we consider the problem of assessing the predictivity of SNPs that are selected by performing genome-wide association studies. Internal cross-validation (ICV) is a wrong but often used method for this assessment. With ICV, a subset of SNPs are pre-selected based on all samples then cross-validation (CV) is applied to assess the predictivity of the preselected SNPs. The predictivity estimate of the selected SNPs given by ICV is upwardly biased. This is often called the feature selection bias problem. The cause of this bias is that the feature selection procedure, which is a part of training procedure, is not external to the test samples in ICV. A correct method, called external cross-validation (ECV), is to re-select features based on only the training samples in each fold of CV such that the feature selection is external to test samples. The feature selection bias of ICV has been discussed by a few articles in the context of cancer diagnosis with microarray data. However, this problem has not received sufficient attention in the literature, especially in the context of predicting with SNP data. Many articles in the literature use ICV or do not state explicitly that their feature selection is external to test samples. In this thesis, we use an example of predicting late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease (LOAD) from selected SNPs to demonstrate that ICV could lead to severe false discovery. We use a real SNP dataset related to LOAD and two synthetic datasets (simulated response with real SNPs) for this demonstration. For the prediction, we compare the performances of three regularized logistic regression methods: LASSO, elasticnet, and a fully Bayesian hyper-LASSO method. For the LOAD dataset, we see that, except for APOE, no other SNPs can improve the prediction of LOAD using ECV method; however, the predictivity estimate of selected SNPs given by ICV can reach an R as high as 80%. For the synthetic datasets, we obtain the similar results as in the real dataset; additionally we see that the predictivity estimate of selected SNPs obtained with ICV can be even higher than the oracle predictivity of the truly related SNPs used to generate the response. In this study, we also find that the hyper-LASSO method can achieve better predictive performance than the LASSO and elastic-net. We recommend that ICV should not be used to measure the predictivity of selected SNPs and this statement should be made clear in research articles.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Mei Dong"", ids = ""144070953"")",,,,,
da53e428445b08763902d422d5ac3c1218545bed,A Refinement of Lasso Regression Applied to Temperature Forecasting,"Abstract Model predictive controllers use accurate temperature forecasts to save energy by optimally controlling heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment while achieving comfort for occupants. In a â€œsmartâ€ building, i.e. one that is outfitted with sensors, temperature forecasts are computed from data gathered by these sensors. Recently, accurate temperature forecasts have been generated using relatively few observations from each sensor. However, long sensor histories are available in smart houses. In this paper we consider improving forecast accuracy by using up to 24 hours of quarter-hourly readings. In particular, we overcome forecast inaccuracy that arises from the â€œone standard errorâ€ heuristic (1SE) in lasso regression. When there are many historical observations, low variance in the error estimations can result in excessively high values for the lasso hyperparameter Î». We propose the midfel refinement of lasso regression, which adjusts Î» based on the shape of the error curve, resulting in improved forecast accuracy. We illustrate its effect in a setting where lasso regression is used to select sensors based on forecast accuracy. In this setting, midfel lasso regression using many historical observations has two effects: its improves accuracy and uses fewer sensors. Thus it potentially reduces costs arising both from energy usage and from sensor installation.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bruce Spencer"", ids = ""145017382""); list(name = ""Omar Alfandi"", ids = ""2795714""); list(name = ""Feras Al-Obeidat"", ids = ""1398013762"")",7315d34fe5313df01c6da208f51496d188ecf9ef; 242256789df458e489c26b1349b7d4ec5b339ec0; fe326688a8c8af1be8519cf96194d74e7d61a2cb,,,,728-735

First, under heteroscedastic errors, we study the performance of shrinkage-type estimators and their performance as compared to theunrestricted and restricted least squares estimators. In order to accommodate the heteroscedastic structure, we generalize an identity which is useful in deriving the risk function. Thanks to the established identity, we prove that shrinkage estimators dominate the unrestricted estimator.

eb68cfebf12687e8b1cd3f80a353bd642ef4e7e2,Abstract 1387: Development of novel antiangiogenic biologics: multifunctional VEGF traps,"Current anti-VEGF biologics have been successfully used as therapeutic agents for cancer and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Since these strategies target VEGF systemically, side effects, long-term toxicities, such as proteinuria and thromboembolic events, and need for frequent eye injections in AMD treatment, prevail. Therefore, the aim of this study was to generate novel anti-VEGF biologics that inhibit VEGF activity specifically at the desired target site. Two classes of antibody-based recombinant proteins were engineered that simultaneously bind VEGF and either: 1) the extracellular matrix (ECM) or 2) target-site specific antigens. The first subgroup of proteins, â€œshV-H trapsâ€, is comprised of a Fc domain shortened form of VEGF-trap linked to a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids, with various affinities for heparin sulfate proteoglycans of the ECM, designed to have a short systemic half-life. The second subgroup of molecules, â€œV-lassosâ€, is composed of a C-terminus positioned form of VEGF-trap linked to single-chain variable domain antibodies specific for either HER-2 or fibronectin extra domain B (EDB), expressed on tumour cell surfaces or in the vascular bed of solid tumours, respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed in transgenic cancer cell lines in a doxycycline inducible manner and were shown to inhibit VEGF activity and also retain the native function of their constituent domains. Specifically, the shV-H traps adhered to the ECM and the HER-2 V-lasso inhibited the proliferation of HER-2 positive cancer cell lines. Xenograft studies were performed using the aforementioned transgenic cancer cell lines in order to determine the efficacy of shV-H traps and Vlasso. shV-H traps were able to inhibit or delay tumour growth of A-673, Pc-3 and HT-29 xenografts. In contrast to soluble VEGF-trap, sh-VH traps were retained at the tumour site and were undetectable in the circulation. Moreover, sh-VH traps did not cause any of the side-effects observed with soluble VEGF-trap, such as delay of wound healing and regression of trachea blood vessels. Both Vlassos were able to inhibit or delay the tumour growth of SKOV-3 and A-673 xenografts. Furthermore, the transgenic approach for inducible expression indicated that HER-2 Vlasso is more effective compared to anti-HER-2 Ab and VEGF-trap used alone or in combination. Preliminary results suggest that high recombinant protein levels can be generated via large-scale production in 293F cells, indicating that the new multifunctional VEGF-traps can be produced in large amounts for clinical studies. These novel classes of anti-angiogenic molecules could potentially be advantageous in a clinical setting. Furthermore, they can be useful in order to further study and understand the mechanisms involved in VEGF inhibition. Finally, similar dual function proteins can be designed for inhibition of other molecules with disease relevance. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

99cc90968765ab1741b1c3fedec2f5900c42a634,Modified Colon Leakage Score to Predict Anastomotic Leakage in Patients Who Underwent Left-Sided Colorectal Surgery,"Colon leakage score (CLS) was introduced as a clinical tool to predict anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery, but its clinical validity has not been widely studied. We evaluated the clinical utility of CLS and developed a modified CLS (m-CLS). In total, 566 patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery were enrolled and categorized into training (n = 396) and validation (n = 170) sets via random sampling. Using CLS variables, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied for variable selection and predictive signature building in the training set. The model's performance was validated in the validation set. The predictive powers of m-CLS and CLS were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the overall group. Twenty-three AL events (4.1%) were noted. The AL group had a significantly higher mean CLS than the No Leakage group (12.5 vs. 9.6, p = 0.001). Five clinical variables were selected and used to generate m-CLS. The predictive performance of m-CLS was similar in training and validation sets (AUROC 0.838 vs. 0.803, p = 0.724). In the overall set, m-CLS was significantly predictive of AL and performed better than CLS (AUROC 0.831 vs. 0.701, p = 0.008).

Municipalities benefit from computational insights such as the quantification of the unicipalities' business landscape. This enables them to calculate the number of businesses they need to attract in a sector and in which ones they are positioned at or above average. We refer to this variable as market saturation. To the best of our knowledge nobody has yet tried to evaluate or build a platform independent service which allows municipalities to answer this question. We provide a solution to this problem and suggest a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architecture, which can assess the number of suitable businesses for a municipality. We calculate these numbers by applying a LASSO regression and are able to predict the amount of businesses with a high degree of precision. Based on our previous findings about the non-linear distribution ofbusinesses in municipalities, we believe we can thus model thenumber of businesses in Switzerland's municipalities and founda way to distribute this knowledge through a hybrid IT architecture.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Daniel Muller"", ids = ""143904874""); list(name = ""Funk Te"", ids = ""3453437""); list(name = ""Irena Pletikosa Cvijikj"", ids = ""2405758"")",7b00c186275590b4c11f883193f2dde7f7b7f830,7029a4d3f44d041bafa8fecfaadca8f4c64f1e4c; 3c24c8b2079dea244a357cfaa28e15a09ddefedc; f5c659caf671595a0b56fced2d88a8deb7e85822; 7d778ad2dd3b79164e1c2a09636cb9f024f4fd9b; 70ad73834b38cfc87674ca24678a22db9fe3f4c4; c9967597caf1aee82314823838b325ac2699d3b6; 3bf15ab4d56ae13d4880e7e7df4c6a0fd71cb27b; 4d493f1165c49d4210bc6f85a9591fcba5120a2d; d5afece4d02a36b661e989a62a8dd22290c3047c; d1d6b1a46b340fa19ffd6d05225658d2c3fb0564,2016 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES),,68-71

Furthermore, feature covariates were consequently selected via a method called Nonparametric Independence Screening (NIS) so that the dimension of multivariate regression was reduced. Finally, a Group-Lasso algorithm was adopted to perform multivariate nonparametric regression in order to form a prediction function for transient stability awareness. An IEEE-39 bus case study demonstrated that the prediction function trained by correlation learning not only assessed the stability of the disturbed power system accurately, but also provided the evaluation of stability margin of the fault contingencies.",2015,Engineering,"list(name = ""Tingjian Liu"", ids = ""30668863""); list(name = ""Youbo Liu"", ids = ""9834389""); list(name = ""Junyong Liu"", ids = ""2388564""); list(name = ""Jing Gou"", ids = ""48556396""); list(name = ""Gareth A.

17017741b701ba0765a6cdf1524008583e51ed33,Novel machine learning and correlation network methods for genomic data,"Author(s): Song, Lin | Advisor(s): Horvath, Stefan | Abstract: Both correlation and mutual information (MI) are common co-expression measures. MI has a major advantage to measure non-linear relationships. However, it is not clear how much MI adds beyond standard (robust) correlation measures or regression model based association measures. We provided a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and correlation in 8 empirical data sets and in simulations. We confirmed close relationships between MI and correlation in all data sets. The biweight midcorrelation, a robust form of correlation, outperformed MI in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships. Coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often led to modules superior to MI and maximal information coefficient (MIC) in terms of gene ontology enrichment. In addition, we proposed the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to MI for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables. Overall, our results indicated that MI networks could be safely replaced by correlation networks for stationary co-expression data.Sample classification, especially disease status prediction, is an important area of investigation for gene expression studies. Many machine learning methods, i.e. predictors, have been developed to tackle this problem. We proposed a novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor randomGLM (RGLM) that shares superior accuracy and good interpretability. RGLM incorporates several elements of randomness and instability, such as random subspace method, optional interaction terms and forward feature selection. The prediction performances of various predictors were evaluated on hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data and simulations. RGLM often outperformed alternative methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso) in both binary and continuous outcome predictions. Further, RGLM provides variable importance measures that can be used to define a ``thinned"" ensemble predictor (involving few features) retaining excellent predictive accuracy.RGLM has won the 2012 COPD Improver Challenge, in which we aimed to predict the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status based on gene expression data. We outlined how RGLM compared with random forest on the COPD data set, and discussed potential reasons for the superior performance of RGLM in this sub-challenge.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Lin Song"", ids = ""144741081"")",69e901b5984ffb6951c47bed06aaeaa42980309c,956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff;

a345ddc8d5cb6c53969591a226264c19bcad357d,Parallel Lasso Screening for Big Data Optimization,"Lasso regression is a widely used technique in data mining for model selection and feature extraction. In many applications, it remains challenging to apply the regression model to large-scale problems that have massive data samples with high-dimensional features. One popular and promising strategy is to solve the Lasso problem in parallel. Parallel solvers run multiple cores in parallel on a shared memory system to speedup the computation, while the practical usage is limited by the huge dimension in the feature space. Screening is a promising method to solve the problem of high dimensionality by discarding the inactive features and removing them from optimization. However, when integrating screening methods with parallel solvers, most of solvers cannot guarantee the convergence on the reduced feature matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel framework by parallelizing screening methods and integrating it with our proposed parallel solver. We propose two parallel screening algorithms: Parallel Strong Rule (PSR) and Parallel Dual Polytope Projection (PDPP). For the parallel solver, we proposed an Asynchronous Grouped Coordinate Descent method (AGCD) to optimize the regression problem in parallel on the reduced feature matrix. AGCD is based on a grouped selection strategy to select the coordinate that has the maximum descent for the objective function in a group of candidates. Empirical studies on the real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed parallel framework has a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art parallel solvers.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qingyang Li"", ids = ""1895668""); list(name = ""Shuang Qiu"", ids = ""48332181""); list(name = ""Shuiwang Ji"", ids = ""1743600""); list(name = ""Paul M.

ab91b9f1ff463fffb38f00996a5f7699d4dd032c,Counting pedestrians in crowded scenes with efficient sparse learning,"Counting pedestrians in crowded scenes provides powerful cues for several applications such as traffic, safety, and advertising analysis in urban areas. Recent research progress has shown that direct mapping from image statistics (e.g. area or texture histograms of people regions) to the number of pedestrians, also known as counting by regression, is a promise way of robust pedestrian counting. While leveraging arbitrary image features is encouraged in the counting by regression to improve the accuracy, this leads to risk of over-fitting issue. Furthermore, the most image statistics are sensitive to the way of foreground region segmentation. Hence, careful selection process on both segmentation and feature levels is needed. This paper presents an efficient sparse training method via LARS (Least Angle Regression) to achieve the selection process on both levels, which provides the both sparsity of Lasso and Group Lasso. The experimental results using synthetic and pedestrian counting dataset show that our method provides robust performance with reasonable training cost among the state of the art pedestrian counting methods.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Masamichi Shimosaka"", ids = ""3050718""); list(name = ""Shinya Masuda"", ids = ""3268025""); list(name = ""Rui Fukui"", ids = ""2893583""); list(name = ""Taketoshi Mori"", ids = ""144920562""); list(name = ""Tomomasa Sato"", ids = ""153042618"")",f8889eb99767fdb8c04c77e0e1a56772e743093f; b1da4b09bb8289b0c357f2f14f854c2723ae612d; 6ecaf2978d1d5a6a4101eac7a862fb560cf6191c; b64bea2340c4903d7235eb8906cc6bf64d9e2004; a8a7441c7b23eca1660052169de2086852fa1cc9,295895e5bd013c33ef0a62b89d41397e3238d8fa; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; a06547951c97b2a32f23a6c2b5f79c8c75c9b9bd; c8430c5d13834e46631960469d86f7ed4577b0e2; 4521ac382772e90607c23af1cff34a04df37e6c4; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 11306994903932518efeec24c1df9b2a5b061d51; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 9f1ac1a1f79e8a829d0acf3a3bf35ed1512d3e53; 568c9f604f0ed4e1549ed58102c59874d56bc30e; 01417d2ec37c46e46fe77ccd54b89ef893513aaf; cbe9176abf0c98c7abdfd136f53d58620f8acfec,The First Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition,,27-31
5911d207033aaf8e23b42ee40c7df84f8d1ad4a1,Data driven modeling and estimation of accumulated damage in mining vehicles using on-board sensors,"The life and condition of a MT65 mine truck frame is to a large extent related to how the machine is used. Damage from different stress cycles in the frame are accumulated over time, and measurements throughout the life of the machine are needed to monitor the condition. This results in high demands on the durability of sensors used. To make a monitoring system cheap and robust enough for a mining application, a small number of robust sensors are preferred rather than a multitude of local sensors such as strain gauges. The main question to be answered is whether a low number of robust on-board sensors can give the required information to recreate stress signals at various locations of the frame. Also the choice of sensors among many different locations and kinds are considered. A final question is whether the data could also be used to estimate road condition. By using accelerometer, gyroscope and strain gauge data from field tests of an Atlas Copco MT65 mine truck, coherence and Lassoregression were evaluated as means to select which signals to use. ARX-models for stress estimation were created using the same data. By simulating stress signals using the models, rain flow counting and damage accumulation calculations were performed. The results showed that a low number of on-board sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes could give enough information to recreate some of the stress signals measured. Together with a linear model, the estimated stress was accurate enough to evaluate the accumulated fatigue damage in a mining truck. The accumulated damage was also used to estimate the condition of the road on which the truck was traveling. To make a useful road monitoring Erik Jakobsson et al.

a2ce29e9932736f4c1388d088c744294678cd8a5,A Semi-automatic Method to Guide the Choice of Ridge Parameter in Ridge Regression,"We consider the application of a popular penalised regression method, Ridge Regression, to data with very high dimensions and many more covariates than observations. Our motivation is the problem of out-of-sample prediction and the setting is high-density genotype data from a genome-wide association or resequencing study. Ridge regression has previously been shown to offer improved performance for prediction when compared with other penalised regression methods. One problem with ridge regression is the choice of an appropriate parameter for controlling the amount of shrinkage of the coefficient estimates. Here we propose a method for choosing the ridge parameter based on controlling the variance of the predicted observations in the model. 
Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method outperforms subset selection based on univariate tests of association and another penalised regression method, HyperLasso regression, in terms of improved prediction error. We extend our approach to regression problems when the outcomes are binary (representing cases and controls, as is typically the setting for genome-wide association studies) and demonstrate the method on a real data example consisting of case-control and genotype data on Bipolar Disorder, taken from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and the Genetic Association Information Network.",2012,Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""Erika Cule"", ids = ""2727331""); list(name = ""Maria De Iorio"", ids = ""39747992"")",e2bd95179601312f32256adf3db5c7b3b47cbf09; 6db7cea733b84b06123278a379629ff2db948e39; bfb547fc4624dc3cb5d64a8e00207fd9250d3ec7; 96236986f79b9db22df11868469b711c142dcd01; aef2e7c25de7ad4b1505a994efd5e863b85e9a11; 8d9089a17926fd3ca37a6ead612351709f355b1f; 05b97d0424123bdce212146ead93175c600d391c; 7a31d196e268745d89e6e09f3db77306f435e76c; 3e38f9b8beca4b9af5b1b0ae0a1610c62cf5992c; 5d99174dd66c6df8186175ac9e66c63b1c0779d2; 0a2b453b539910206ed0aeae1dae69d854d98468; a29796afc5bd8f12af37da346a465244fc163085; 3beedf28dc1ab4ccfbb8ebb83acc5547776ca259; 88e75c146d9285aac0c6377165c6c94ce2819d29; 187fad0eddb04ebee4c3ea80bc988d2321c2d20e; 55da4f54cff1f3621f487dbeefd5524a494cfb5f; c5e9c37187da86c94f56985eb9a40166231dcb9e; 695f7334263e767c55868706b4344122796bc38a; 52818a6534ad7d38dda6e59fe027e5b759d4c5e3; 2cd0c8104626fe90ef8898b2561cd1711b9ccb58; 0205c0cb14e59925b42fef29f6d44d7bd8c59ba0; 2d5cc86e3534faa12164abc194fb764130e46548; f6add779d567cf9ea075139e8ee1e04646b1c72c; dcc103d958915a1e9e32eec0ef23b5a38b9c4e58,6ef46cb18946dac5ad250f41df87f5c1c1745a1e; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; ba6cd102cd8dfb4de88074faf4e4da95e0ac0ead; fff8fadc3c7850bd0f3f00941101d6a0ca9d6fa9; 571c89c796c258ea7b17d4bff6f1e682a8cac669; bd69301378a79afc10ab3466e7598bad04b8d660; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; c4964fc619d76e5e383c9b228399c79b9af6a0bb; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; 582bc5d5e5dc6dcb92e3665a34110ef886a115cc; e9fde5617b15623d1151d152671626df06aa5c2a; 1aa7d5324390546d43e873903159ff58e365c10f; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 6a10eaedec9d402fb8d8b8900994d0aa27c5e129; 44ad920f1d046adb042ea6a33d4b216f2d76ba81; 7627f1bb7a0d022151b273f18304a64e9dc4a786; 721d4d33ca29c6e3ed440a9dfe5799187d43f7fc; 75637242a1c8c121974d26119bbed46e9442c1cc; dbc83fbe6a1832e3a93a869c9aa1cad5340c4d6f; af17c4d43033be816d0be0b8f434b3d6d58463ab; e69bce0185720fcb652ae458a4529a2807f53de8; caed0df3873c72fba1b9afe8094a273a3dc2a017; 3a5224354b1631efde9329f31e9610936bba3d3a; 30a98d4faea2d90d4c3438a946ca96f88b636ff1; 3f3bd8a304941d3bccaa122b314a9c8f747029b6; 06778d3e840c40cd65d41e5096d3156febcb5311; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; dc69e42d3d2f228234d409b47e13d8d4d6ad60b7; c4335289faa7625d4c043c180ebc2dd3c8a3a109; 77aeb3da209dbb9470a03a542af9d8c319c3edff; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 3107276a535d17a3fb33f4af4df0f5b82296e85a; d49bfad00101a03ac3e964bea3717c75a5bb3210; 9c9be246b96869798d8263e1912dbcd94815711c; a6f2edec04dad5538ccccb66829b5cfdff7fcd20; b2d8a0dee043cc644c1432e956ecae9ca447f62e,arXiv: Applications,,

449f3329b725a1ce079b72a69e50b284aa28c29c,Integrating spatial-anatomical regularization and structure sparsity into SVM: Improving interpretation of Alzheimer's disease classification,"Abstract In recent years, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the field of neuroimaging for classification and regression tasks. However, many approaches do not give an intuitive relation between the raw features and the diagnosis. Therefore, they are difficult for clinicians to interpret. Moreover, most approaches treat the features extracted from the brain (for example, voxelwise gray matter concentration maps from brain MRI) as independent variables and ignore their spatial and anatomical relations. In this paper, we present a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€based learning method for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which integrates spatialâ€anatomical information. In this way, spatialâ€neighbor features in the same anatomical region are encouraged to have similar weights in the SVM model. Secondly, we introduce a group lasso penalty to induce structure sparsity, which may help clinicians to assess the key regions involved in the disease. For solving this learning problem, we use an accelerated proximal gradient descent approach. We tested our method on the subset of ADNI data selected by Cuingnet et al. (2011) for Alzheimer's disease classification, as well as on an independent larger dataset from ADNI. Good classification performance is obtained for distinguishing cognitive normals (CN) vs. AD, as well as on distinguishing between various subâ€types (e.g. CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment). The model trained on Cuignet's dataset for AD vs. CN classification was directly used without reâ€training to the independent larger dataset. Good performance was achieved, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed methods. For all experiments, the classification results are comparable or better than the stateâ€ofâ€theâ€art, while the weight map more clearly indicates the key regions related to Alzheimer's disease.

Pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas manifested as lung nodules less than 3 cm were retrospectively identified. In-house software was used to quantitatively extract 60 CT-based radiomics features quantifying noduleâ€™s volume, intensity and texture property through manual segmentation. In order to differentiate AIS/MIA from IA, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used for feature selection and developing radiomics signatures. The predictive performance of the signature was evaluated via receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve, and validated using an independent cohort.Results402 eligible patients were included and divided into the primary cohort (n = 207) and the validation cohort (n = 195). Using the primary cohort, we developed a radiomics signature based on five radiomics features. The signature showed good discrimination between MIA/AIS and IA in both the primary and validation cohort, with AUCs of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91â€“0.98) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84â€“0.93), respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that the signature (OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 6.2â€“28.5; p < 0.001) and gender (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2â€“10.9; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of indolent lung adenocarcinoma.ConclusionThe signature based on radiomics features helps to differentiate indolent from invasive lung adenocarcinoma, which might be useful in guiding the intervention choice for patients with pulmonary nodules.Key pointsâ€¢ Based on radiomics features, a signature is established to differentiate adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma from invasive lung adenocarcinoma.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunlang She"", ids = ""8852489""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""39089563""); list(name = ""Huiyuan Zhu"", ids = ""50319301""); list(name = ""Chenyang Dai"", ids = ""8530852""); list(name = ""Dong Xie"", ids = ""145042408""); list(name = ""Huikang Xie"", ids = ""48327622""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""47528149""); list(name = ""Lilan Zhao"", ids = ""10222361""); list(name = ""Liling Zou"", ids = ""32934084""); list(name = ""Ke Fei"", ids = ""77437260""); list(name = ""Xiwen Sun"", ids = ""46794356""); list(name = ""Chang Chen"", ids = ""39065865"")",45d20111bd63d008ca54e691c8efbf718d2dd1d4; fd1db38bd039f6af710fcf08a0bb2987086ef65b; b37f037cb6c225a483f7e96814521cc4e08f3cb0; b79fe15b9617c798af79f397e27cfa6d3e098389; 606b0f207446a93d7d5466086d2140d46b0ec025; f42ae3af924f6bc007fd897c64f51f8500581ef8; 4d035263bc6904a2724a580525133ab05d1a6db9; 7f6d47967fa8fa77a56bb041ece7330f6ed5878f; 25f18a5b2283ea0119ebff4afabeac3c7f4db8bc; 047d3ea934550f0c13858479c6625b4928409dd0; ea3750927904e2e17cd772ec4fc3e627cdcd18dc; 3319e8f148a69aea4776cc6e525835e3f337f4c2; 08412617bfcc6e2f094a6e6785ee5e3fe02129a9,a6133261507af708881817166842d62b67ddff36; cf1e595bffd17ab203cd02f9cc9a983628fd766a; 43e22221a1b659ff56e22de5ee505c6de054c8ea; 96555685c5d0f3ab636f8db445d1a9c384ce33d2; fc202e2cf47da15b7e87674f2a01e5e92d66df3f; 92b19ed9dc71aea3701f4d06f52ff4aae260d9a4; 420049d945d4f79db93c136f1df516914a672ad2; 2ecd6a1677849ad6d1805178443a2d2968a808eb; 0576e16689572c82d11e3a4cbed590fb41ab0fc7; adb8ea62246ce252825827653427fe19681a0f76; a4ad66f3046d34f63c0a9ea20dcaef633036ea14; 0d9c006a87488a1106fa8e7910f5f805a72ebbf5; 1f5f79b464ccd853e63cdfea0bb22bdb06507fff; dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a; 193eaa25c0d7deafb36f9eaadfe18d1046ff06b4; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; 1d72f25545d93332b7e2f5d7211655e63d864796; c414fe56cb4ea37f3289ce2d70bf5f8478ab6be1; ba10a616715b79b73362e969f738230d14be6830; 0e423d26b195eb3ac49890201016c2366e949580; ce7e456dc263c3a9a874eec78dde3e554f1b4229; 38e4f6205cb6dc37ef54d10eccfddea96a035bbd; 6d4107d1fecdaadc4f4dd5f4cc030ab05b0cde30; ac304a3bbf9120776b6381d3dcec177f7ce92941; cf4023883b1b005b409d7f0d42a1187737cfe090; 62a2c3777ed4accd7683a4f1523c64cf6c9e26b4; 41b5f47c340cddd5cc0ca43bba43ceea0cc441a6; dc5ec579972bc1386e012747f704fca2b443374e,European Radiology,28,5121-5128
2925f119be1c6a379692e683c4f804a83e3faa30,Linear regression analysis for interval-valued data based on the Lasso technique,"A new method for linear regression analysis of interval-valued data is proposed. In particular, the linear relationship between an interval-valued response variable and a set of interval-valued explanatory variables is investigated by considering two regression models, one for the midpoints (the locations of the intervals) of the response and explanatory variables and the other one for the radii (the imprecision). The regression coefficients of the two models are estimated in such a way that those for the midpoints are close to the corresponding ones for the radii as much as possible. Taking inspiration from the Lasso technique this is done by fixing a threshold expressing the maximum allowed level of diversity between the two sets of regression coefficients. The results of a simulation experiment and some applications to real data are reported in order to show the usefulness of the proposed method, called Lasso-IR (Lasso-based Interval-valued Regression).",2011,,"list(name = ""Paolo Giordani"", ids = ""144358207"")",3d27f03ec99e1f95291311358933ce18f1b132f7; 78e4ba3d52770070cb19711f159ae81ab3ab5f27; 852739075c930a3caf5cc3aaee898539110afd9e; 3096036df34ed2273d1bc69a59018c927c498696; df9eaa4ca6185ee714452ac0d07145758dd8f7a8; 058483712d6d010107cce57ad3222db6c1564047; 1c19cdc4747f0ff867581e72648c8f19d38b6594,8132feccf5c829f292826145ce4a6d6328856a5e; 510cf21d8ecab9483646a022e2322d46795a80aa; ffe3a7d9d6380fa8c3149c92a535c7f064fb10a8; f20e686d89a62cd05867bd86c935d0a149d22c9d; c7716875d99e68e0b8c4c9ab4f1acd0e05e16e57; 251f34665382e67e4f32d97b70b9f439e9b5d469; 460e431fc30bbd98ce2dd57e6e61755713490e8d; 8d0a5e3f02d2ecf3cf8d4992ba24c345d78754a9; 8d89d6366860eca459af0ad000602f4829227bf4; 541498f61321899c716d49efc89eb529ea3fb280; ce7113e61bca0f90ddc6ed8c8844f1539d5d778e; 040cf85e53e48aab1512ed8dd02d994eea0e4bcc; b8d9abd1c078573188b13d36c1b1efb7cb2fa865; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,,,

Peripheral venous catheterization (PVC) exposes patients to complications, mostly phlebitis. This study investigated the incidence of phlebitis and its PVC-related risk factors among patients in the medical and surgical emergency departments of the Souro Sanou University Hospital Center (CHUSS) in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. This prospective cross-sectional study took place from July 4 to August 3, 2018. The incidence of PVC-related phlebitis was calculated and its risk factors were identified by logistic regression, with SPSS software version 20 (entry option), with significance set at 5%. The 511 patients included in the study had a mean age of 44.7 (95% CI 43.1-46.3) years. The mean duration of PVC was 3.1 days. Of these patients, 149 developed phlebitis, for an incidence of 29.2% (95% CI 25.0%-33.0%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two emergency (medical and surgical) departments. Second-degree phlebitis accounted for slightly more than half the cases (53%). Risk factors associated with the occurrence of PVC-related phlebitis were female gender, catheterization duration more than 3 days, small size of the catheter, and the healthcare worker's failure to use friction in washing with a hydroalcoholic hand solution.

bd2fb6b30c0b7838a3ff34f1345813d3347c2ed4,Machine learning modeling of plant phenology based on coupling satellite and gridded meteorological dataset,"Changes in the timing of plant phenological phases are important proxies in contemporary climate research. However, most of the commonly used traditional phenological observations do not give any coherent spatial information. While consistent spatial data can be obtained from airborne sensors and preprocessed gridded meteorological data, not many studies robustly benefit from these data sources. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to create and evaluate different statistical models for reconstructing, predicting, and improving quality of phenological phases monitoring with the use of satellite and meteorological products. A quality-controlled dataset of the 13 BBCH plant phenophases in Poland was collected for the period 2007â€“2014. For each phenophase, statistical models were built using the most commonly applied regression-based machine learning techniques, such as multiple linear regression, lasso, principal component regression, generalized boosted models, and random forest. The quality of the models was estimated using a k-fold cross-validation. The obtained results showed varying potential for coupling meteorological derived indices with remote sensing products in terms of phenological modeling; however, application of both data sources improves modelsâ€™ accuracy from 0.6 to 4.6 day in terms of obtained RMSE. It is shown that a robust prediction of early phenological phases is mostly related to meteorological indices, whereas for autumn phenophases, there is a stronger information signal provided by satellite-derived vegetation metrics. Choosing a specific set of predictors and applying a robust preprocessing procedures is more important for final results than the selection of a particular statistical model. The average RMSE for the best models of all phenophases is 6.3, while the individual RMSE vary seasonally from 3.5 to 10 days. Models give reliable proxy for ground observations with RMSE below 5 days for early spring and late spring phenophases. For other phenophases, RMSE are higher and rise up to 9â€“10 days in the case of the earliest spring phenophases.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bartosz Czernecki"", ids = ""25054007""); list(name = ""Jakub Nowosad"", ids = ""47304667""); list(name = ""Katarzyna JabÅ‚oÅ„ska"", ids = ""52175246"")",fc785b75b946d081ba431ae3592fd46a864c1f92; 77234a1b507fbd25c09b36c7f1d23166a10f844d; 76666b90d5426013dfc59c3c119ab80489b2652a,9739f7c963191891f04d56d1138b93a6c815d141; c8d1a80f39d317122abcd26b1900188344334f47; 051f0060f68a330aed7f16726eee1bff474551b0; 593495a41cdd1e0b32fbd9141c01969480a03d49; a6136ff9e51a2dab773dafe2a67376dc9e2012b0; c1cb88db8ec60bc2c4cc7c6abd8a10c0f7fc9e40; db5fe88a487545db9e26afc5ba34646b54af19a4; 1679beddda3a183714d380e944fe6bf586c083cd; b854c59cf33de912dc8e27591ce84e7298921faf; d7d4e474392501c1bd6f17f2b12844831e0b8bbb; 2dfa9890e25e75e34625183b4a99a5b21a6774fd; 42581c3891b5a9b89e11061c2ac9ada48001c321; eeed8c7361485fbdb3badfcfa0d19ef54ecb4e71; ecc2ca3150dc4d4d8dceedab244114f191e05742; bdcd4d04ee10426569227061655108419731020d; d661323a92e02efe8f8b2acb08936d2e95c6d573; 424c3193b6358154409f2bad2b3999588905e370; e9e40317aed8a6e3e54d42ade0944a93e6e79574; c66b5a9feec026ee9cd7c5f125c7bc2987ae0626; 84728279f63895fa24b536ae0d67493981081309; 2a6c5836ecec108119540775520c39269216fe9f; 9fb230668c72046dc1866e263827677bc31603e0; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; efa863bde2d7fdf9fa01360eef4ae329e30108a0; a4bf9236571d93194c749150bf17ba9cfbb069fb; 33d8d976142b38d8cf6be620864157b019fbdfc9; 95b16050e6632a61452637bcdb9260225298de5b; 9f8abdc8dbd229300a25c86cf5d49f649ec7165d; cdba215d78f36bec804a447585de736364c7206d; 9bc283f1ce0338ff867e88c050eb5a2f206133dc; 61a1064bbf2a4fda034ab51927e8edf0b5117023; c6f1d4c5024b4a2e00a7f9fabbe5f28b90083539; 88ec56e60a5d4ccf023f98e040d98e66e7b6be56; c556e25ef384b36a720202195c8be899dd32b228; a042031113be9dae4ec36c353613c02947821cfe; 1c2b4e46402544b62ba94eddc5bf6ada72067e4d; 8b2a102479a0a3894bc3c64d2f751894b2f5bc0f; 972b173505f42604591461619666b30379689767; 2c7d7f9559ead1d74eb1d519fa859c408365ae57; 471141e357adde215ed13d2a7b4704059ad4cdc4; b44f973e2652e4450ce4b50f3e4912e33189a08d; fb4eb7b2329eb94c5e1cf46651bae9be8314a4c0; ece69347acfaa4cdb7ad5e2e4732a932e6cfde8d; 041dc0af3c468ce803d948ab37aea63cfdb033f6; 52a0521494c46f393d449dd8ef90ed470c462978; 225a304bb2d44cf43b80446dd515415ba0059f7f; 8a6d2fa1e255547ca5b82a29707b432fdff2a178; c4131557b1465f9f72de128a84e883a81f3de6c6; a3dcb8ce333ecf78623b882bb69888556784e5b3; 335b4621ba1e988d6a59e9c3d8ed42eea9d4f167; b43636a459095ab30606d19f8d86340eb26be176; 9d9dca3ececbae043bc83151dfdc7b698259c6aa; 2f735ee65edd5331bf0f4ceed6677ae789407163; 4c6d662b204c2ba056c3785a11a94be7186cf0a8; 2e7bc658e606c9a6b1b0391e3bcea909554a1fe9,International Journal of Biometeorology,62,1297 - 1309

On the operational level, enrollment-related issues may be mitigated by careful site selection and by allocating monitoring or training resources proportionally to the anticipated risk of poor enrollment. Such procedures require estimates of the expected recruitment performance that are sufficiently reliable to allow centers to be sensibly categorized. In this study, we investigate whether information obtained from feasibility questionnaires can potentially be used to predict which centers will and which centers will not meet their enrollment targets by means of multivariable logistic regression analysis. From a large set of 59 candidate predictors, we determined the subset that is optimal for predictive purposes using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization. Although the extent to which the results are generalizable remains to be determined, they indicate that the prediction accuracy of the optimal model is only a marginal improvement over the intercept-only model, illustrating the difficulty of prediction in this setting.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rutger M van den Bor"", ids = ""13752324""); list(name = ""Diederick E Grobbee"", ids = ""3880818""); list(name = ""Bas J Oosterman"", ids = ""14294106""); list(name = ""Petrus W.J.

dec5b5907d162693177e07a761b843f8fe8b6765,Regularization and Estimation in Regression with Cluster Variables,"Clustering Lasso, a new regularization method for linear regressions is proposed in the paper. The Clustering Lasso can select variable while keeping the correlation structures among variables. In addition, Clustering Lasso encourages selection of clusters of variables, so that variables having the same mechanism of predicting the response variable will be selected together in the regression model. A real microarray data example and simulation studies show that Clustering Lasso outperforms Lasso in terms of prediction performance, particularly when there is collinearity among variables and/or when the number of predictors is larger than the number of observations. The Clustering Lasso paths can be obtained using any established algorithm for Lasso solution. An algorithm is proposed to construct variable correlation structures and to compute Clustering Lasso paths efficiently.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Qingzhao Yu"", ids = ""3080638""); list(name = ""Bin Li"", ids = ""39713252"")",,16be505a697b47dad717ac0853434e5831880702; 910f8df95db7849036910e5773dcc9b09e70f03f; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; 36b40e07dbd0fd44e16328154469011b8c1f8b0f; 8bf730243ed967afd5349bef053641a6043517a0; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697; 0025fc4f00c21960297fbdf83220d6bde75da645; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 74a6c8ffb2995afce8adb5c8ef353402a914267d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 4004fe098dd8b575d742aaffc021a6af319198b8; ee1477dcbf768cd589cdcf45ca8f9427666dfe4d; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; 5d49c9554e30b66091cb8a75db93cc670db04034; 80d5869f211be1fc2252647549942ba418521e59; fb6b4b57f431a0cfbb83bb2af8beab4ee694e94c; 8d6081993c9a65f333597582e6b60e7ab593b8ac,Open Journal of Statistics,04,814-825
0306841f1841ee890603e078ae133d05679a55c7,Sparse multi-class prediction based on the Group Lasso in multinomial logistic regression,"Continuous variable selection using shrinkage procedures have recently been considered as favorable models in a wide range of scientific research; in particular biomedical research. In some cases, it is desirable to select as few predictors as possible, to increase the interpretability of the attained prediction rule. One frequently used shrinkage procedure; the Lasso, imposes a L1 regularization on the regression coefficients of general linear models, inherently leading to sparse prediction rules. When dealing with multi-class prediction in generalized linear models each predictor has a regression coefficient for each class. A major disadvantage is that the Lasso selects individual regression coefficients instead of the more logical selection of predictors. In this paper, we demonstrate a new regularization procedure, based on the Group Lasso in multinomial logistic regression. This results in a lower number of retained predictors, but with similar prediction accuracy when compared to the regular Lasso regularization. To illustrate the new regularization applicability we have employed it on a large cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML, n=531) who are characterized on a gene expression microarray.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Margaret Ann Sanders"", ids = ""49968307"")",ba8a2ac51c72d1fd798370dd083c8dc53147a9d9,,,,
