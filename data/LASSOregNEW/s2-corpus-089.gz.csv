As the main research methods for the current research there were used LASSO Regression method with a regularizer and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm. The time series from 1991 to 2018, transformed into the form of annual percentage changes, were used as the initial data. At the beginning, a preliminary selection of features was made, and further two corresponding models were formed on the basis of the selected hyperparameters. As an additional target variable, a series of production was created with a time lag of one period in relation to the rest of the series. The degrees of the linear and nonlinear relationships for various types of food are determined, as well as differences in aggregates of crop production and animal husbandry are revealed. General recommendations are given within the framework of the policy for the development of the institutional environment of agribusiness and its foresight systems.",2020,Economics,"list(name = ""Roman Borisovich Shestakov"", ids = ""114042788""); list(name = ""Nikolay A.

5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9,Adaptive Lasso for Sparse High-dimensional Regression Models,"We study the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimators in sparse, high-dimensional, linear regression models when the number of covariates may increase with the sample size. We consider variable selection using the adap- tive Lasso, where the L1 norms in the penalty are re-weighted by data-dependent weights. We show that, if a reasonable initial estimator is available, under ap- propriate conditions, the adaptive Lasso correctly selects covariates with nonzero coefficients with probability converging to one, and that theestimators of nonzero coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution they would have if the zero co- efficients were known in advance. Thus, the adaptive Lasso hasan oracle property in the sense of Fan and Li (2001) and Fan and Peng (2004). In addition, under a partial orthogonality condition in which the covariates with zero coefficients are weakly correlated with the covariates with nonzero coefficients, marginal regression can be used to obtain the initial estimator. With this initial estimator, the adaptive Lasso has the oracle property even when the number of covariates is much larger than the sample size.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jian Huang"", ids = ""50535559"");

438d24e2a0c3e7bf24ebdfe880a723b321ba32c3,Yield Forecasting of Spring Maize Using Remote Sensing and Crop Modeling in Faisalabad-Punjab Pakistan,"Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmersâ€™ field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35â€“6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255Â kgÂ haâˆ’1, while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397Â kgÂ haâˆ’1. Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.",2018,Geography,"list(name = ""Ishfaq Ahmad"", ids = ""145687237""); list(name = ""Umer Saeed"", ids = ""35041607""); list(name = ""Muhammad Fahad"", ids = ""153866529""); list(name = ""Asmat Ullah"", ids = ""49351675""); list(name = ""Muhammad Habib ur Rahman"", ids = ""36168531""); list(name = ""Ashfaq Ahmad"", ids = ""47679727""); list(name = ""Jasmeet Judge"", ids = ""145339492"")",8052fa9eabeab131fcd87e0b3a4a40611ec6d8a6; 753d816942420a5fe95d111bff11c2737d177d49; 51fbee632583a483c779e8ff85b5603f2cf2fd44; 2b81a1435a52055c24f80949c3a4b15b682de1cd; 07e889a1444eb0f0ba6f52d8b2b0a65d730e6853; 00953b416d289c59cc8abe4bc1a0751e0e5e4fca,76aac04e0c240423f19751fb6945964adae5e3e4; 2a2135439ce08f7560671f4a22b2cacba0f108d0; b930efd88aabe9eeb3b8b5de7910ff4f47a045e4; aa53aec2057fca4a337e96a879719243df9b8701; 28791034f020c794622b006d0b2179a3e08a678d; a05cca2c46be8f50bea8890190a6997226471631; e75c7cf0c577bb931fb71ec978050b537aa776f9; 64bf250591a368746680185b65c3aa4e73d2e42a; dc3e57dadea569feb567291be297fe7b69ab319d; dfb5d412f452f2bdf39341987b1e3e7c85044728; 549047157066e55df84763159fb815f308ecb2b4; 21a8aaceb8984952950f3ebdd4bfd445813419c8; a82ce65a976df1cc9dc41cb56b76bd8726cb129e; 16955e8ed7922acfbe03eaaee70adb1ecea06bd4; 46b4201fd370d07fcddd87223eff17797f7fa08e; 5363fc1cdae2b28cfb4cd36353b439243f9b03ab; bad0e2cbf01ad976b4bb557022b479e8ede090c1; 99f5fb98af9b8182c71a08ea1c38a3f8a57197fd; dc80ad168cb6d8bdf4e03befc3cab9d2801aa4a0; 53bec6469e1ed78171fae686ce3da5449490d642; 8ee1490b44c6c387889bee71c0836c003a2208dc; fabdb3002faadd08135f9fc604122e15d6ad0d6f; 2345cfb9b30ea3924ad1c771aead7fc64ab6e1fb; 1e0ac6f8084bc7df530ff6a9e227ee646e1a01b2; 2567eedf6495913454d4e68d711d469d91d3ea7a; 6ebbc69ebdf3efb97210ce3ebc07062b90d38e9a; 754b99747fce21b3a8ed1da060ab27616c5252e6; 2f3f991ea305cbaeaeb6a5bf9dad7fd2a369d4f1; 1acbf9b5a745085ec76a9c9a3584646076273cac; 30ba4a3990ac98255fdbf522fb759ef3cc9dac4e; 3d1bccfc201e19b22971786674a62603f2cad686; 021befc1b24922edd5b3f5cd66424cada2c7e1bc; 39091d0be7a4206931ce7f7c6bd15f7f727f2c98; f9122147dab63f605e4c80206c349360df99bf46; 67d6744f7f7a1b9936ffd61df49243ef90522cf3,Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing,46,1701-1711

While the effort has revealed significant findings to better understand the biology of complex disease, such as cancer, combining more than two ?omics data will certainly explain further biological insights not found otherwise. For this reason, in the last five years the idea of integrating data has appeared in the context of system biology. However, the integration of ?omics data requires of appropriate statistical techniques to address the main challenges that high-throughput data impose. In this thesis, we propose different statistical approaches to integrate ?omics data (genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics from tumor tissue, and genomics from blood samples) in individuals with bladder cancer. In the first contribution, a framework based on a multi-staged strategy was proposed. Pairwise combinations using the three ?omics measured in tumor were analyzed (transcriptomics-epigenomics, eQTL and methQTL) to end with the combination of all of them in triples relationships. The results showed a whole spectrum of relationships and sound biological trans associations identifying new possible molecular targets. In the second contribution, a multi-dimensional analysis was applied to the three ?omics considered together in the same model. Penalized regression methods (LASSO and ENET) were applied since they can combine the data in a large input matrix dealing with many of the ?omics data integration challenges. Besides, a permutation?based MaxT method was proposed to assess the goodness of fit while correcting for multiple testing which are the main drawbacks of the penalized regression methods. We obtained a list of genes associated with genotypes and DNA methylation in cis relationship that were further externally validated in an independent data set. Finally, the same approach was applied to integrate the three ?omics data in tumor with the genomics data in blood samples in an integrative eQTL analysis. This approach was compared with the 2 stage regression (2SR) approach previously used for eQTL integrative analysis. Our approach highlighted relevant eQTLs including the ones found by the 2SR strategy generating a list of genes and eQTLs that may be considered in future analyses. Overall, we have shown that ?omics integrative analysis is needed to find missing or hidden information. To this end, applying appropriate statistical approaches is needed identify sound biological relationships.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Silvia Pineda San Juan"", ids = ""89925451"")",,,,,

This study aims to select an optimal RNA signature for prognostic prediction of GBM patients. For the training set, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles of 151 patients were downloaded from the TCGA. Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were identified between good prognosis and bad prognosis patients. Optimal prognostic mRNAs and lncRNAs were selected respectively, by using univariate Cox proportional-hazards (PH) regression model and LASSO Cox-PH model. Subsequently, four prognostic scoring models were built based on expression levels or expression status of the selected prognostic lncRNAs or mRNAs, separately. Each prognostic model was applied to the training set and an independent validation set. Function analysis was used to uncover the biological roles of these prognostic DEGs between different risk groups classified by the mRNA-based signature. We obtained 261 DEGs and 33 DE-lncRNAs between good prognosis and bad prognosis patients. A panel of eight mRNAs and a combination of ten lncRNAs were determined as predictive RNAs by LASSO Cox-PH model. Among the four prognostic scoring models using the eight-mRNA signature or the ten-lncRNA signature, the one based on the expression levels of the eight mRNAs showed the greatest predictive power. The DEGs between different risk groups using the eight prognostic mRNAs were functionally involved in calcium signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway. The eight-mRNA signature has greater prognostic value than the ten-lncRNA-based signature for GBM patients based on bioinformatics analysis.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhenyu Gong"", ids = ""1423858496""); list(name = ""Fan Hong"", ids = ""145494869""); list(name = ""Hongxiang Wang"", ids = ""46506782""); list(name = ""Xu Zhang"", ids = ""50982410""); list(name = ""Juxiang Chen"", ids = ""50763372"")",,4ded589ade972db59751e6fc97ab102cf7ee1157; 7426039a83ee46bf9e5681818436cf5a0a3366a5; 584c4d68c40eff47abf0ab19dde86e63b386fd17; 0c629bf518cfd1446e371366a9dde2fdd4baa006; e6e6eb82857762a8ecfdca02165ba5d7fd4f79f6; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; cd9ccd0ef7ab181d453fb04f74c9996dd456e6ca; b58e62361f231278c9163f1819f6e42fa42a7643; 1414e6e6fb118c2aec8a13d9e3084d12800c9226; ba97810cd6a0c499781bc756b707be2b53a41a7f; 3cb6958f3e052c2d7ae88392c6b91f82d8c74a57; a5e5370c34732042a8ed017c4dd40dfa9873cdec; 025c3924079b4b593f9f1bac30b665cf3a65c33c; 66f82fe169a8ee2370765e932afef3cc27f0f90e; 5652ff3c4cccac1543e211adaf00775dd28247fe; 4447e659eb621ed0a603f15bd722b1750a1d7137; 5fffc6042d9ef9ac1383cb8f7d338280f3efab24; 17b38ac95fb252832a0dcef3f4eb24fa0f4cc0e7; 5c344c22bce127555650ba83b6b89aa2c80d1dc3; b3e8da3a5b6a5a757ceae545a6aeda7d9d7bfc9a; a8ce1d83f1e46dbb4a7978b4c6550ac5f82260b2; 942ea89019b8786c4ef116b642294bba07aa1c6e; 6183425162284e292ec1235691165c79ca60a1ee; d17859485f8af84f69eb9e5ae2e45f4d352d1c58; 3a61d744a94299afdf58b001d38f82a2bcaa5753; c49b338ba069503a5f514e4fb80ea8c4c791d03c; bfb7192581c44323fedfa403082d13d9984ccc3d; 2d976a70453feb068e173612a00162012b755a56; 5603656d27ad714cebcb661e6d4089e9c7f34e37; 8216a63d2fc9e783099250a6d9eade7c77dfb399; eca6ccc0646a8e748189df46533a018d7b204b2d; 44e6003463d10a4f645c60408406d3ed20c701c2; 5e7b605b25c886843742d28c171b7affafa5a5c6; 527757ffe4eb098e77c1ad50b54b1a87f650575d; f3a6c90ba9595fabe64fab57b0f40c2c788da0bd; b9fc55eac4fa7abceddc5b4d9c15281f0d0c845d; 79c7e4a3b5f4c9463129c918f9412e1d613fc349; 9573af5d649b6162d646765b7dcd594c30db4104; 8592c35578bd53595589b2fb2596fb691c08813b; 5f83fea377fbbcc111f819b1c67a0310c8623a5f; 841c8275fea9a6a70fcd763ade1d2986d48d844e; 618bc6f82601065353d6d343d4c3112f58f8f0b3; fc3a761ec67ed383f04138746e653ed9a4632f78; 5d469374b9273941807e5c2063641bed40aed06f; be419d1dbe0e86baeaed3dfa243ef52132532da4; 32b7d800d7e5dc097e362d7210fc73d9793e5f15; cc39419ef826c6f332c069091fc9a5c34a66c31e; 9921323d2ae02f840f3410a83ff7dce02e1a16a5; 9df98946b0a84c8365411cf332767c27ff7bff37; df0434aae5ab46cb3b81359be2db9341f4a7a1e5; 6e5512fe5d152d7ef374e2e3b0c19e7adcccee83,BMC Medical Genetics,21,

We also derive an oracle inequality and closely examine restrictive eigenvalue conditions. In this paper, we give the details for Cox models with time-varying coefficients. The theoretical results on variable selection can be easily extended to some other important models and we briefly mention those models since those models can be treated in the same way.

09643aa26bb8118fbac4116b351bc5d8d2305c56,A six-CpG-based methylation markers for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in blood.,"DNA methylation markers in the peripheral blood are able to be applied to treat epithelial cancer. Nevertheless, the diagnostic potential value of it for ovarian cancer (OV) has not been studied. The study aimed to explore the difference of DNA methylation in peripheral blood between OV patients and healthy women. Firstly, the whole blood of DNA methylation data was provided by the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The linear model was applied to the identification of significantly differentially expressed methylated CpG sites (differentially methylation sites [DMP]), and the further screen of co-expression CpG sites (Co-DMP). A total of 2812 DMPs were identified, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis helped to obtain seven co-expression modules. Among them, the yellow module was the most related to OV. Co-DMPs (167) in the yellow module were mainly distributed near the transcription start sites. However, most of them were not in the CpG island. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was applied to the identification of stable OV-related blood biomarkers that six Co-DMPs (cg00134539, cg00226923, cg25268718, cg25697314, cg25839227, cg26574610) with the highest frequency were found as potential biomarkers. Finally, the diagnostic classifier was established using the support vector machine (SVM) with the accuracy rate of 87.1% and 74.5% in training data set and validation data set, respectively. To sum up, a new feature was provided here for the diagnosis of OV, which is helpful for the diagnosis and individualized treatments of early OV.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""48170277""); list(name = ""Sha Ni"", ids = ""48846996""); list(name = ""Zhenhua Du"", ids = ""144338935""); list(name = ""Xiuqin Li"", ids = ""47058286"")",,,Journal of cellular biochemistry,,

This work is motivated by the need to develop a risk scoring system from survey data on risk factor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is a major health, production and financial problem for swine producers in nearly every country. Group lasso provides an attractive solution to this research question because of its ability to achieve group variable selection and stabilize parameter estimates at the same time. We propose to choose the penalty parameter for group lasso through leave-one-out cross-validation, using the criterion of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Survey data for 896 swine breeding herd sites in the USA and Canada completed between March 2005 and March 2009 are used to construct the risk scoring system for predicting PRRS outbreaks in swine.

86da9ab9069ba38b733bc64b5c05dee278801f5e,Feature selection based on regularization of sparsity based regression models by hesitant fuzzy correlation,"Abstract In this paper, the Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net regression methods are adapted for the task of selecting feature. In order to enhance the feature selection performance via these methods, a Hesitant Fuzzy Correlation Matrix (HFCM) is added to the objective functions of these models for addressing the minimum redundancy of features. To this end, the fuzzy C-means clustering is utilized, and the obtained fuzzy clusters are projected on the features in a way that the number of fuzzy Membership Functions (MF) for each feature is equal to the number of clusters. Then, the projected MFs on each feature are considered as a Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS), and thereby the hesitant fuzzy correlation between features is calculated. Afterward, the obtained HFCM is employed in the regression methods for securing the minimum redundancy of features. Eventually, the accuracies of the selected features, achieved by these methods, are determined by three different classification models such as Naive Bayes, SVM and Decision Tree. A large number of experiments are conducted over twenty-four classification datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of using HFCM in some classical regression methods.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mahla Mokhtia"", ids = ""1659096743""); list(name = ""Mahdi Eftekhari"", ids = ""1879637""); list(name = ""Farid Saberi-Movahed"", ids = ""1466240669"")",,,Applied Soft Computing,91,106255
6daf08b0ba4f6efaa56bb20e8ff2b86629288ee8,Comparison Between Linear and Non-parametric Regression Models for Genome-Enabled Prediction in Wheat,"In genome-enabled prediction, parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric regression models have been used. This study assessed the predictive ability of linear and non-linear models using dense molecular markers. The linear models were linear on marker effects and included the Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B. The non-linear models (this refers to non-linearity on markers) were reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression, Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNN), and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN). These statistical models were compared using 306 elite wheat lines from CIMMYT genotyped with 1717 diversity array technology (DArT) markers and two traits, days to heading (DTH) and grain yield (GY), measured in each of 12 environments. It was found that the three non-linear models had better overall prediction accuracy than the linear regression specification. Results showed a consistent superiority of RKHS and RBFNN over the Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B models.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paulino PÃ©rez-RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""1399269445"");

3a9ba5bbcc3cbc97141c04982886a60797d4d9b3,"Obesity, Central Obesity, Overweight and Diabetes: Women are the Most Affected in Burkina Faso","Objective: To determine the importance of obesity and analyze the relationship between general obesity and central obesity in persons with diabetes monitored in Bobo-Dioulasso teaching hospital. 
Methods: We used a sample of 380 persons with diabetes recruited through a study on compliance with follow-up examinations. Overweight and obesity were researched using the Quetelet index, or Body Mass Index [BMI], which is defined as the individualâ€™s mass divided by the square of their height, as well as waist size. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression were used [p<0.05]. 
Results: We found that 22.6% were obese [n=86], 29.2% were overweight [n=111] and 65.3% had central obesity [n=240]. The majority of obese [98.8%] and overweight cases [87.4%] and also 40.0% of those with normal BMI [n=160] and 8.6% of underweight cases [n=23] had central obesity. Being a woman was associated with general and central obesity. In a univariate analysis, obese were more likely to be woman, educated, have low incomes, reside in urban areas and have central obesity and a metabolic syndrome; central obesity is associated with being a woman, having a low income, residing in an urban area and having hypertension, obesity and a metabolic syndrome. In a multivariate analysis, being a woman, educated and having central obesity was found to be associated with obesity. On the other hand, being a woman, residing in an urban area and having hypertension, obesity and a metabolic syndrome remained associated with central obesity. 
Conclusion: Obesity, and above all, central obesityis a big problem in persons with diabetes, particularly in women in Bobo-Dioulasso, and waist size seems to be a better measurement compared to BMI.

ba89ffaada98f87b567d5cf615e67d104a652dca,Confidence intervals and regions for the lasso by using stochastic variational inequality techniques in optimization,"Summary 
 
Sparse regression techniques have been popular in recent years because of their ability in handling high dimensional data with built-in variable selection. The lasso is perhaps one of the most well-known examples. Despite intensive work in this direction, how to provide valid inference for sparse regularized methods remains a challenging statistical problem. We take a unique point of view of this problem and propose to make use of stochastic variational inequality techniques in optimization to derive confidence intervals and regions for the lasso. Some theoretical properties of the procedure are obtained. Both simulated and real data examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the method.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shu Lu"", ids = ""145713173""); list(name = ""Yufeng Liu"", ids = ""46399637""); list(name = ""Liang Yin"", ids = ""48089519""); list(name = ""Kai Zhang"", ids = ""145489257"")",304ddf95e2a39e2a3f2a196d35623d4adb168254; 58f5be2ad4c12284bd8db53d4661ce853d849248; 73ee4ccca339c754283197a4fc807df44cbf4d2a; f6e6e164bfc18f4a41e99eba657b9f946f6a03de; 38fa4431eb31ecf809f6000064472f3950588e42; bcbadb66aaff9402a126d1accc36a55314082f9b; da07c28ee46316227ab61c1cb0ebd0854181a30b; 68d3c63c4958d8ecb6f0694854c26d4b9f1d0d48; 74a8230998e5314bd38cf116622be57149abd6af; e36e22b5e387f1abc722049fb89fd4cdcd1386e4; 3b81308ebc5132ba4c002e3d509deafb90a155b3,20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; c8d4be093cd4da26f0402b6b9b2680d7ffae2959; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 59a45558657e93aed40a2f5c73bbd50a8d76dda0; 6e79cd2f1b8f03f4b94cd258659cd758f7d52e51; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 14e751b428d9c23148331f6215a699bcf0f3ddd4; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; d97d7f1109206fe6925badd934b4c8dc9a3b380d; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; 2d2ca0a06be3f597e94310b9fc78a350d0dbfcfa; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; 113b10df570f00ed2065e5e6fb2259b44ab94f1d; a5385e302ad6cc7c82c84096290989a02c96c0fd,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,79,589-611
29365331f6a56938bdcd2abd8e186d127a709af0,Learning Local Dependence In Ordered Data,"In many applications, data come with a natural ordering. This ordering can often induce local dependence among nearby variables. However, in complex data, the width of this dependence may vary, making simple assumptions such as a constant neighborhood size unrealistic. We propose a framework for learning this local dependence based on estimating the inverse of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which variables are predicted by their neighbors. Our proposed method involves solving a convex, penalized Gaussian likelihood problem with a hierarchical group lasso penalty. The problem decomposes into independent subproblems which can be solved efficiently in parallel using first-order methods. Our method yields a sparse, symmetric, positive definite estimator of the precision matrix, encoding a Gaussian graphical model. We derive theoretical results not found in existing methods attaining this structure. In particular, our conditions for signed support recovery and estimation consistency rates in multiple norms are as mild as those in a regression problem. Empirical results show our method performing favorably compared to existing methods. We apply our method to genomic data to flexibly model linkage disequilibrium. Our method is also applied to improve the performance of discriminant analysis in sound recording classification.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Guo Yu"", ids = ""48056614""); list(name = ""Jacob Bien"", ids = ""2154667"")",f6599d7b81f13eb5f71e77297ccf94bc18957200; 2ba2c62facbbfb6a689cd3bb62b25d2bbfd44f3e; d1528bfa6bc35d1afc5c8a741c55df3b2a87b710; 08054ad91d099019455c77577fa4cfd0c824d1ae; e4aafdc8350d8e0a084d9b4e3befee94b453efdc; 509ff1f5496a6a316711a3d578be8a9041c68fe4,31d495c134b6ec8d29985699f0708598b749b517; 5b573a9f42ec2e9c384be886a5b1eae688b8ba3c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e03748570662f7e2c37e60dcf429b880e45f2189; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; cb59554e76f45f344bc60b97a6144dbb4cb0de05; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; 73694794fed5f68ccfdaeda76a00eca4dea230ea; 44165956328b5d07c82d95e682648efcb09ecc8f; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; 5cc657d5295f6091a3ef4ac898bf15342f5ed26e; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; ed796d7626d70749afb0bf713429198f74c8f3df; 910f8df95db7849036910e5773dcc9b09e70f03f; 31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 19f90a8c59b2b5924debf81fc38c53f2f445b236; a645bc96aa224b3e4c40ea9ad8c1d319d38fa9f5; 02b24f4376e8ff17d6c4179b548b2c8d7934cce4; 2540b36616761e6fde519eed00aef8f0e5e412a0; a310c1018197e6dbb1e1e45c23d6ac50ac272e20; dc0c0afe4d2033bbe49d40df8a7d4194a6142f4e; 80db408970c1b8d4ebb664ac313bf5c452f95671; eba49f4e6256f44fb6a2fab5ee95519e9a9fb49f; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; cb507858c4546fe102bea4dd1274ea2a748fb176; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 9a3edc623b5ffa7522ed8f37c01ce4b5125002ad; 37b573e791a5e41ef3b59e6f68f58a8cbe9f8cdf; 9e8d3337e3aa9686b2f70d9db0b4bb9eb6f9d9b1; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; 398ff09f1ef9fdc1d70f59eeb744f06c06998528; 93d617c2891e450ba8d5cd4149ba4fc38c962295; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; f36c762eef6d0bbb3d7e5d29f226e234f070344e; 43b3440fd8ec728ea6e57df25f3f686f5eca26f1; 5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778; 3b754b458b125772fee0460957d69366d07bb864,J.

97adeb530113dd553c1df145d499a49e6f8ee099,"A Temporal Examination of Platelet Counts as a Predictor of Prognosis in Lung, Prostate, and Colon Cancer Patients","Platelets, components of hemostasis, when present in excess (>400â€‰K/Î¼L, thrombocytosis) have also been associated with worse outcomes in lung, ovarian, breast, renal, and colorectal cancer patients. Associations between thrombocytosis and cancer outcomes have been made mostly from single-time-point studies, often at the time of diagnosis. Using laboratory data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we examined the potential benefits of using longitudinal platelet counts in improving patient prognosis predictions. Ten features (summary statistics and engineered features) were derived to describe the platelet counts of 10,000+â€‰VA lung, prostate, and colon cancer patients and incorporated into an age-adjusted LASSO regression analysis to determine feature importance, and predict overall or relapse-free survival, which was compared to the previously used approach of monitoring for thrombocytosis near diagnosis (Postdiag AG400 model). Temporal features describing acute platelet count increases/decreases were found to be important in cancer survival and relapse-survival that helped stratify good and bad outcomes of cancer patient groups. Predictions of overall and relapse-free survival were improved by up to 30% compared to the Postdiag AG400 model.

b253da1fa544aed534bd8abea993358f0bbe5831,Using Multivariate Regression Model with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to Predict the Incidence of Xerostomia after Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a multivariate logistic regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to make valid predictions about the incidence of moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with IMRT.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Quality of life questionnaire datasets from 206 patients with HNC were analyzed. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-H&N35 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires were used as the endpoint evaluation. The primary endpoint (grade 3(+) xerostomia) was defined as moderate-to-severe xerostomia at 3 (XER3m) and 12 months (XER12m) after the completion of IMRT. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were developed. The optimal and suboptimal numbers of prognostic factors for a multivariate logistic regression model were determined using the LASSO with bootstrapping technique. Statistical analysis was performed using the scaled Brier score, Nagelkerke R(2), chi-squared test, Omnibus, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the AUC.


RESULTS
Eight prognostic factors were selected by LASSO for the 3-month time point: Dmean-c, Dmean-i, age, financial status, T stage, AJCC stage, smoking, and education. Nine prognostic factors were selected for the 12-month time point: Dmean-i, education, Dmean-c, smoking, T stage, baseline xerostomia, alcohol abuse, family history, and node classification. In the selection of the suboptimal number of prognostic factors by LASSO, three suboptimal prognostic factors were fine-tuned by Hosmer-Lemeshow test and AUC, i.e., Dmean-c, Dmean-i, and age for the 3-month time point. Five suboptimal prognostic factors were also selected for the 12-month time point, i.e., Dmean-i, education, Dmean-c, smoking, and T stage. The overall performance for both time points of the NTCP model in terms of scaled Brier score, Omnibus, and Nagelkerke R(2) was satisfactory and corresponded well with the expected values.

6aec1f8a12f1b2c0c9d1ad620d8c7e25bf9b0bd1,UV-induced DNA damage in coral reef fish: damage levels and protection mechanisms,"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the surface of earth has been recognized as a major environmental stressor for marine organisms due to the potential of UVB (280 315 nm) to induce DNA damage such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) that can lead to cell death. Despite inhabiting a UV-rich environment, the levels of DNA damage in reef fish and factors influencing these levels are unknown. Whether reef fish are able to avoid UVR and repair UV-induced DNA damage is unclear despite the importance of these protection mechanisms in other animals. The presence of UV-absorbing Mycosporine-like Amino Acids (MAAs) in the external mucus of reef fish has been confirmed, however the efficiency of these compounds in preventing CPDs has not been studied. The aim of this PhD was to assess the impact of ambient and elevated levels of UVR on reef fish in terms of UV-induced DNA damage, and to evaluate the protective mechanisms available to fish with and without UV vision. In order to determine the net level of DNA damage in skin samples of 15 species of fish from the reefs surrounding Lizard Island, a CPD-specific antibody was used in an ELISA. Analysis using a boosted regression tree shows that the most important factors governing CPDs were species and size, with higher damage being detected in smaller individuals. Other factors such as family, depth and the presence or absence of UV vision contributed the least to the variation in damage. The length of exposure to natural levels of UVR over the course of a day was found to have no significant influence on net DNA damage levels, which were relatively low in situ, compared to levels that were detected in later experiments using elevated UVR. The first protection mechanism, behavioural avoidance to UVR, was tested using behavioural experiments in which fish with (Pomacentrus amboinensis) and without UV vision (Thalassoma lunare) were given a choice between UV-protected and UV-exposed compartments. Additionally, foraging behaviour of settlement-stage larvae of P. amboinensis was determined under ambient levels of UVR. Automated analysis of video footage using MatLab shows that neither species showed a specific avoidance response to varying levels of UVB. Although P. amboinensis showed a preference for deeper sections of the experimental tanks, fish spent equal amounts of time in exposed and protected compartments. The foraging activity and distance to shelter of P. amboinensis that were exposed to UVR were significantly reduced compared to fish that were observed under light conditions that lacked UVR. Next, the efficiency of natural sunscreens, MAAs, in preventing CPDs was tested in P. amboinensis and T. lunare. The levels of MAAs in the mucus of the two species were either reduced or maintained during captivity before exposure to a short pulse of high UVR. Spectrometric measurements of light transmission through mucus samples collected after irradiation were used to quantify the amount of MAAs available for protection. In both species, DNA damage levels in skin samples from UVR exposed individuals was higher than in control groups that were exposed to light lacking the UV component. Spectrometric measurements of external mucus of both species revealed a clear link between higher mucus absorbance, i.e. MAA levels, and lower DNA damage levels. Furthermore, a significant increase in mucus absorption was observed in P. amboinensis after UV exposure. The last protection mechanism, the ability to revert DNA damage via photoreactivation and dark repair was investigated in four species (P. amboinensis, Pomacentrus moluccensis, Lethrinus variegatus and Siganus corallinus). All species examined showed significant increases of DNA damage after exposure to elevated UVR levels. Interspecific variation in the susceptibility to UVR was observed, with L. variegatus showing the highest damage levels. Significant reductions in DNA damage levels were found in P. moluccensis and L. variegatus that were exposed to photoreactivating light after the initial damage accumulation. Individuals of P. moluccensis that were shielded from any light exposure post UVR exposure also showed less DNA damage at the end of the experiment. This is the first study to address levels of UV-induced DNA damage in reef fish under natural conditions as well as under elevated doses of UVR that could occur in a changing climate. The relatively low levels of CPDs in a diverse group of reef fish indicate that current levels of UVR pose only low threat and underline the importance of protection mechanisms against UVR. Increases in UVR could have an impact not only on adult fish capable of adjusting their protection mechanisms, but also settlement stage larvae which show some of the highest levels of DNA damage in situ as well as mortality during slight increases of UVR. Whether these and other effects such as decreased foraging activity have broader implications on the recruitment and reproduction of reef fish and the community structure on coral reefs needs to be examined in the future.

58bbda1519d7cf7011f67ec3cdfaaf5e5df74f77,"Chronic pain, somatic unexplained complaints and multimorbidity: A mutimorbidity painful syndrome?","INTRODUCTION
Chronic illnesses are a major research challenge due to its implications in aging and quality of life of adults and elders, and it can be associated with chronic illnesses and other complaints. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of morbidities (chronic diseases with or without somatic unexplained symptoms) and somatic unexplained complaints in a hypothetical model of a multimorbidity painful syndrome. Our hypothesis is that chronic pain should be considered part of a syndrome that includes other chronic diseases and pathological states, especially conditions with somatic unexplained symptoms, and fibromyalgia is one of the evidence on that.


METHODS
A pilot sample of 306 subjects was investigated in this study (254; 83.0% with chronic pain). The following features were investigated: demographic data, chronic diseases (classified as with or without somatic unexplained symptoms), medications in use, pain characteristics, fulfillment of diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia, and somatic unexplained complaints (gastric complaints, sleep disturbances, numbness, and the dry mucosa score). Statistical analysis included descriptive data, tested with chi-square, Fisher's exact, nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnoff, Student's t test; data normalization with Z-score; Pearson's coefficient for correlation, two-steps cluster classification, multivariate linear regression, LASSO and logistic regression.


RESULTS
Both groups of chronic diseases were more prevalent in the group of patients (pÂ <Â 0.001 and pÂ =Â 0.013, respectively), which had higher frequency of somatic unexplained complaints (gastrointestinal, dry mucosa and numbness) than controls. There was a high positive correlation between number of pain areas and somatic unexplained symptoms score (R2Â =Â 0.626; pÂ <Â 0.001), and diseases with these symptoms were a risk factor for chronic pain (R2Â =Â 0.5748) and fibromyalgia (AICÂ =Â 5.8952).


CONCLUSIONS
Diseases with somatic unexplained symptoms and somatic unexplained complaints were associated with chronic pain, including fibromyalgia. They may be risks factors for pain spread. The findings support that chronic pain could be further investigated as part of a multimorbid syndrome, which should be better assessed to improve aging and quality of life of patients.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Silvia Siqueira"", ids = ""4085252""); list(name = ""Jose Tadeu Tesseroli de Siqueira"", ids = ""4070909""); list(name = ""Manoel Jacobsen Teixeira"", ids = ""51327136"")",,,Medical hypotheses,138,"

a54d33bac9c2af9ffc93dbd9fd0d9ee4fe39fab5,Aeroelastic Model Structure Computation for Envelope Expansion,"Structure detection is a procedure for selecting a subset of candidate terms, from a full model description, that best describes the observed output. This is a necessary procedure to compute an efficient system description which may afford greater insight into the functionality of the system or a simpler controller design. Structure computation as a tool for black-box modelling may be of critical importance in the development of robust, parsimonious models for the flight-test community. Moreover, this approach may lead to efficient strategies for rapid envelope expansion which may save significant development time and costs. In this study, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique is investigated for computing efficient model descriptions of nonlinear aeroelastic systems. The LASSO minimises the residual sum of squares by the addition of an â€˜1 penalty term on the parameter vector of the traditional â€˜2 minimisation problem. Its use for structure detection is a natural extension of this constrained minimisation approach to pseudolinear regression problems which produces some model parameters that are exactly zero and, therefore, yields a parsimonious system description. Applicability of this technique for model structure computation for the F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing using flight test data is shown for several flight conditions (Mach numbers) by identifying a parsimonious system description with a high percent fit for cross-validated data.",2007,Engineering,"list(name = ""Sunil L.

1e106f69d32eeda1465c787206c7b5c906042f44,Asymptotic Confidence Regions Based on the Adaptive Lasso with Partial Consistent Tuning,We construct confidence sets based on an adaptive Lasso estimator with componentwise tuning in the framework of a low-dimensional linear regression model. We consider the case where at least one of the components is penalized at the rate of consistent model selection and where certain components may not be penalized at all. We perform a detailed study of the consistency properties and the asymptotic distribution that includes the effects of componentwise tuning within a so-called moving-parameter framework. These results enable us to explicitly provide a set $\mathcal{M}$ such that every open superset acts as a confidence set with uniform asymptotic coverage equal to 1 whereas every proper closed subset with non-empty interior is a confidence set with uniform asymptotic coverage equal to 0. The shape of the set $\mathcal{M}$ depends on the regressor matrix as well as the deviations within the componentwise tuning parameters. Our findings can be viewed as a generalization of Potscher & Schneider (2010) who considered confidence intervals based on components of the adaptive Lasso estimator for the case of orthogonal regressors.,2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Nicolai Amann"", ids = ""123547573""); list(name = ""Ulrike Schneider"", ids = ""46741105"")",,be6acea7508ec46a948d5d521f3ab23ed2d2ac5b; a2ce7f88a24f68c97cf7b9c2c5f6d3864f80eaf2; 71dc66aef9690747c8ab3a779cc9b98d85045966; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 6cd1350af11da392dd0b188ba57167e677494e3f; 3352e59ce4a58e9f12e0942769c1fbd57319d5f2; 7c24dab9a44feed3842eb27be24e17187d6f2dc5; 880cdc02d3125c8d753ef8d34da1750d2b924f93; 3a3e13046a729e007efa4ba9c607e7c7e1768634; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 819562c634d2d4e1369249e94086da8626e75f56,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
3c5cbd903ec024d3db78e1b3c5aa67a3c2b22057,Pattern alternating maximization algorithm for missing data in high-dimensional problems,"We propose a novel and efficient algorithm for maximizing the observed log-likelihood of a multivariate normal data matrix with missing values. We show that our procedure, based on iteratively regressing the missing on the observed variables, generalizes the standard EM algorithm by alternating between different complete data spaces and performing the E-Step incrementally. In this non-standard setup we prove numerical convergence to a stationary point of the observed log-likelihood. For high-dimensional data, where the number of variables may greatly exceed sample size, we perform regularization using a Lasso-type penalty. This introduces sparsity in the regression coefficients used for imputation, permits fast computation and warrants competitive performance in terms of estimating the missing entries.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed radiomics features of CT images in 1,689 consecutive patients from three cancer centers. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. Lasso regression model was utilized to select features and build radiomics signature. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to develop the model. We integrated the radiomics signature, clinical T and N stage, and other independent clinicopathologic variables, and this was presented as a radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Results: The radiomics signature was significantly associated with pathological LN stage in training and validation cohorts. Multivariable logistic analysis found the radiomics signature was an independent predictor of LN metastasis. The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration.

f2edec22b93f3c6e05c5eecadcfc30d3e6ebab64,A combination of tumor and molecular markers predicts a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.,"PURPOSE
Whether patients with stage IA-IIA lung adenocarcinoma require conventional chemotherapy is still a controversy. An ideal metastasis risk prediction model in lung adenocarcinoma is valuable for determining the prognosis and giving timely, individualized treatment.


RESULTS
Analyzing the clinical cases of 153 lung adenocarcinoma patients using an Ï‡2 test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we selected the most valuable factors for determining metastasis and constructed metastasis prediction models. We confirmed the importance of the tumor markers (CEA, NSE) and a molecular marker (CAMKII) as independent prognostic factors in lung adenocarcinoma. The result of a five-year survival status was significantly associated with CAMKII and CEA (P < 0.05). A nomogram was created using CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, and CAMKII to estimate the metastasis probability for individuals, specifically, 78 stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients were used to verify the effectiveness of the nomogram. Using machine learning, LASSO selected the subset of variables that minimized the predictive error of the outcome, including CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, CAMKII, tumor size, histologic type, lymph node status, smoking, and age. A ten-fold cross-validation showed the average accuracy of this model was 86.208%, with an area under the curve of 0.857, a sensitivity value of 0.840, and a specificity value of 0.873.


CONCLUSION
Using both complementary methods, the predictive models illustrated that the combination of tumor markers and a key molecule to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients in early stages is valuable.

25a155d85a4fd66de6ed027905abcff49d0628bf,Multimodel inference for biomarker development: an application to schizophrenia,"In the present study, to improve the predictive performance of a model and its reproducibility when applied to an independent data set, we investigated the use of multimodel inference to predict the probability of having a complex psychiatric disorder. We formed training and test sets using proteomic data (147 peptides from 77 proteins) from two-independent collections of first-onset drug-naive schizophrenia patients and controls. A set of prediction models was produced by applying lasso regression with repeated tenfold cross-validation to the training set. We used feature extraction and model averaging across the set of models to form two prediction models. The resulting models clearly demonstrated the utility of a multimodel based approach to make good (training set AUCâ€‰>â€‰0.80) and reproducible predictions (test set AUCâ€‰>â€‰0.80) for the probability of having schizophrenia. Moreover, we identified four proteins (five peptides) whose effect on the probability of having schizophrenia was modified by sex, one of which was a novel potential biomarker of schizophrenia, foetal haemoglobin. The evidence of effect modification suggests that future schizophrenia studies should be conducted in males and females separately. Future biomarker studies should consider adopting a multimodel approach and going beyond the main effects of features.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jason D.

eaa487e4b66ee19ec89e162085eeff2d0f512902,Sampling Constrained Probability Distributions Using Spherical Augmentation,"Statistical models with constrained probability distributions are abundant in machine learning. Some examples include regression models with norm constraints (e.g., Lasso), probit, many copula models, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel augmentation technique that handles a wide range of constraints by mapping the constrained domain to a sphere in the augmented space. By moving freely on the surface of this sphere, sampling algorithms handle constraints implicitly and generate proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space. Our proposed method, called Spherical Augmentation, provides a mathematically natural and computationally efficient framework for sampling from constrained probability distributions . We show the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, such as exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, using several examples including truncated Gaussian distributions, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian bridge regression, reconstruction of quantized stationary Gaussian process, and LDA for topic modeling.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shiwei Lan"", ids = ""36247254""); list(name = ""Babak Shahbaba"", ids = ""2642138"")",8a13a443f6adb356ec66f761ddd9194642867cf3; 189361d0351ec63bbd4d01a20138d0524d602eaf; 4b25998d6eeb9a639454c2d34fd56564431f10c4; 94c8dde08e388e4297f127a95f987bdad6954ccc; aa8bf6a9f5f6eb2573c9e7ca009ef176992310b2; a2f4d34b9b8afbc50c1b0669d902e8f080a633a2; cd88af6c9b28635a7a1472a01ac2c09b4f36e364,4a7efd34691690c929d44ffa1458cea2bff865e2; b97f1b1f012031e63e30aa78ffea681b0607be53; 71ce231faec79aeb667d7c889d6fc203e2bb95ae; e1103d528d874a9e8e84ca443fe3fd5c1ff9eb9e; db8d4098b044ba3b3979bfa0fdc3da1c0d249fcf; c7a41ebb9a055e164926fb00efcbcafb40f0a16f; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; 43aaf314805d711a137343667f4da5ab3a305e92; ec8e5ea7c421b792871130cc1bd5e074602b1aae; df0c32c4165aecfdc9bb05f61dd43b6c2bad8545; 762cbbbeb46f0b1873cfe1dccb57a37da3a5af3e; f198043a866e9187925a8d8db9a55e3bfdd47f2c; 7a70d7ee172d8ec20754903be6114ca8daf16f7f; 4c3d7bb6bcaa1e49dab561f1a74f236a7d100d68; dd7bbdc9b0cb716b6f3b4a3b565cd6ed555708cc; f079272c3a16b30ae414a4511c64c211f5e64369; ac54930c7f076b881886f240a3d0e516c9a40c66; 86a03544946f617a1581b389e3c32f2d97867982; 8d5c21921ec62cb3518055a3c919a0c822b329b1; c8110bef6d1eaf5b8e028e000d5447437694b2ef; 617111ed3746c4304c87b188ba155b160e9f082e; 0a3873992669e8577a906149a81007cb13c70599; 0f96b0dfc3cc5814fee3ed1f7bcaf45db85d7d06; aeed631d6a84100b5e9a021ec1914095c66de415; 44a47ad4d90310a54667ebab01f300735334792f; 4278c990e87e8f39734701f8a9d2b742b5073f75; 5b458ee989583e9a6a67046ed9441e254a49b1da; 2dd91a48c0912392bba4c0c989bf383eddb609ac; 3f98645200078264ebad85c318d7c2b8f81f61f0; 0ee392ad467b967c0a32d8ecb19fc20f7c1d62fe; 3fc09565a661cb133ab39ae5f169a543ebedb60b; 1542fe458849b1ce26306f68200f6c71ae2ed147; 8fc339912ffc530550d9f03c65f01f4e0f5fefaf; 9a0afa390e05da8afbe949c2ea6f52c7acee0ee6; cc58edaacecbcc20b8a54ad4f68648415a7b974a; 00cf63a7926a826f7cf73c1d5edb117f98d70c2c; 502e8e0d8502ff9d8cbfc565d9360afdfb2aea45; e4f3ec8909370c2fc5b95d6697547837884d20a2; 2939c42d40b6a45fef2429ad09f4a348911d1b48; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 7fe6e93cd6b6ea92dbef1e48be343dc00f437c1b; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; db869fa192a3222ae4f2d766674a378e47013b1b; a2fae29f914bdc555847e689bc91900c2256cb59; a88c4014da492520eceff8b359d981d6ef4b8e5e; d9a16fa2d1067d262c2ad43ce26ee6de0b7b08d2; 0c6b0171fe26bb84e89c244e1f859ebdf86e6e45; 693d3e45ec5077ffa01f343824a54ea64604e11e; c5cd21a41176dfaba5f602810a4c6808c4ff16eb; 1e918d01e7df34379525bd008caaeb547b878aa9; 5824669d4cb17ed933df829f381fefeadb2429f6; 2d8cbd7370b4ce666edd864e66f83ebf20963516; 6b7b53d80e1858df988306019fe97e75c9e76a0e; 75f063c9b32912f4b1b1f08dbcf6b0575ce16bf1; c61418a6a1308ed03acf52d0ad73f9dd71aa74b1; b3295bc1b2df23d0e01ab4c395a27a5a9a867625,arXiv: Computation,,25-71

a8f19518cec18d55d0b530693635779c72fb3b13,Adaptive Lasso Logistic Regression Applied on Gene Expression of Prostate Cancer,"Introduction: The high number of prostate cancer patients has signified the importance of identifying its risk factors. The aim of the present study was to employ stratification method and penalized logistic regression with the adaptive LASSO for selecting appropriate and important genes in prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Microarray data used in this study include a prostate cancer gene expression dataset with [HG_U95B] Affymetrix Human Genome U95B Array platform which consisted of 12,620 genes and 167 subjects, among whom 76 subjects were unaffected and the rest were affected with cancer. Using adaptive Lasso regression, important genes in prostate cancer were stratified and the results were analyzed using ROC analysis and gene ontology annotation. To modify and conduct primary measures on the dataset, SPSS software version 22 was used. To fit the models and draw the diagrams, R software version 3.3.1 and penalty specific packages were used. Findings: According to this research, the obtained adaptive Lasso regression accuracy and confidence interval (CI) were 0.99 and 0.97-0.99, respectively. Considering criteria such as area under the curve and gene ontology annotation, it can be argued that adaptive Lasso regression was fairly effective in stratification and selection of appropriate genes in prostate cancer. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it can be said that in gene expression data, where there are both linear and large scale data, techniques such as adaptive Lasso can be useful in diagnosis of effective genes.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Amir hossein Hashemian"", ids = ""6955757""); list(name = ""Maryam Ghobadi Asl"", ids = ""114742561""); list(name = ""Soodeh Shahsavari"", ids = ""107888420"")",,a6245dcdf8f41c3413493dc3dbbf158c6d81ed70; 38ffa2a46316ed161768afdce5029e3c63979619; 43352807d1811b97a61289201a37a80acf69f870; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 8bf07bc4543bb978b943651fedb8473f9eadfc16; d36c2552ac92835c0d69e8c25b9c75432b822687; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; b188eecc76ca241738297f518d7402f823902225; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 7df8c133c431cdd36978407b9ad45c43e8c71149; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 29454f329fce51f5da1711cf4b1652d0ee62ebd7; d308eb8e56b53aab6cfff4412c573954437cf331; c4e8af354dd2b44c81adcecf2a53c07b7b2f287b,,15,136-141
4bd8c03ca059eef76a6ae8c3a4261264210f5fb1,Untargeted Profiling of Concordant/Discordant Phenotypes of High Insulin Resistance and Obesity To Predict the Risk of Developing Diabetes.,"This study explores the metabolic profiles of concordant/discordant phenotypes of high insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. Through untargeted metabolomics (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), we analyzed the fasting serum of subjects with high IR and/or obesity ( n = 64). An partial least-squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction followed by univariate statistics and enrichment analysis allowed exploration of these metabolic profiles. A multivariate regression method (LASSO) was used for variable selection and a predictive biomarker model to identify subjects with high IR regardless of obesity was built. Adrenic acid and a dyglyceride (DG) were shared by high IR and obesity. Uric and margaric acids, 14 DGs, ketocholesterol, and hydroxycorticosterone were unique to high IR, while arachidonic, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE), palmitoleic, triHETE, and glycocholic acids, HETE lactone, leukotriene B4, and two glutamyl-peptides to obesity. DGs and adrenic acid differed in concordant/discordant phenotypes, thereby revealing protective mechanisms against high IR also in obesity. A biomarker model formed by DGs, uric and adrenic acids presented a high predictive power to identify subjects with high IR [AUC 80.1% (68.9-91.4)]. These findings could become relevant for diabetes risk detection and unveil new potential targets in therapeutic treatments of IR, diabetes, and obesity. An independent validated cohort is needed to confirm these results.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna Marco-Ramell"", ids = ""1422587809""); list(name = ""Sara Tulipani"", ids = ""6660815""); list(name = ""Magali Palau-Rodriguez"", ids = ""1398794706""); list(name = ""RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez-DomÃ­nguez"", ids = ""1397925328""); list(name = ""Antonio MinÃ£rro"", ids = ""144968861""); list(name = ""Olga JÃ¡uregui"", ids = ""143856936""); list(name = ""Alex SÃ¡nchez-Pla"", ids = ""1402187341""); list(name = ""Manuel MacÃ­as-GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""1388894006""); list(name = ""Fernando Cardona"", ids = ""145698716""); list(name = ""Francisco J Tinahones"", ids = ""144057099""); list(name = ""Cristina AndrÃ©s-Lacueva"", ids = ""1398408524"")",7f99411b7925db0fa39fb0b161199c0672728d1f; 16495a06934f03c79b7bc8ecb941d0eceac513ad; ab3a9e862b0a798e9dd2a0456b1273aeb3f34d81; 7d2a429a580e11f6d31adc90ff36be9a1ec97977,,Journal of proteome research,17 7,"

634fc8e7f7c4fd48d78e5bbdbf2a007392f20fe7,Radiomics in predicting tumor molecular marker P63 for non-small cell lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
To establish a radiomics signature based on CT images of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to predict the expression of molecular marker P63.â€© Methods: A total of 245 NSCLC patients who underwent CT scans were retrospectively included. All patients were confirmed by histopathological examinations and P63 expression were examined within 2 weeks after CT examination. Radiomics features were extracted by MaZda software and subjective image features were defined from original non-enhanced CT images. The Lasso-logistic regression model was used to select features and develop radiomics signature, subjective image features model, and combined diagnostic model. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and compared with Delong test.â€© Results: Of the 245 patients, 96 were P63 positive and 149 were P63 negative. The subjective image feature model consisted of 6 image features. Through feature selection, the radiomics signature consisted of 8 radiomics features. The area under the ROC curves of the subjective image feature model and the radiomics signature in predicting P63 expression statue were 0.700 and 0.755, respectively, without a significant difference (P>0.05). The combined diagnostic model showed the best predictive power (AUC=0.817, P<0.01).â€© Conclusion: The radiomics-based CT scan images can predict the expression status of NSCLC molecular marker P63. The combination of the radiomics features and subjective image features can significantly improve the predictive performance of the predictive model, which may be helpful to provide a non-invasive way for understanding the molecular information for lung cancer cells.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qianbiao Gu"", ids = ""66918044""); list(name = ""Zhichao Feng"", ids = ""123268660""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Hu"", ids = ""47027458""); list(name = ""Mengtian Ma"", ids = ""88714334""); list(name = ""Mwajuma Mustafa Jumbe"", ids = ""1384355038""); list(name = ""Haixiong Yan"", ids = ""10233590""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""48989956""); list(name = ""Pengfei Rong"", ids = ""47435530"")",,,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

0370e445c48955ebd893df71f2184e7870bb731c,Statistical Estimation of Correlated Genome Associations to a Quantitative Trait Network,"Many complex disease syndromes, such as asthma, consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical or molecular phenotypes. This raises a new technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. In this study, we propose a new statistical framework called graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) to directly and effectively incorporate the correlation structure of multiple quantitative traits such as clinical metrics and gene expressions in association analysis. Our approach represents correlation information explicitly among the quantitative traits as a quantitative trait network (QTN) and then leverages this network to encode structured regularization functions in a multivariate regression model over the genotypes and traits. The result is that the genetic markers that jointly influence subgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected jointly with high sensitivity and specificity. While most of the traditional methods examined each phenotype independently and combined the results afterwards, our approach analyzes all of the traits jointly in a single statistical framework. This allows our method to borrow information across correlated phenotypes to discover the genetic markers that perturb a subset of the correlated traits synergistically. Using simulated datasets based on the HapMap consortium and an asthma dataset, we compared the performance of our method with other methods based on single-marker analysis and regression-based methods that do not use any of the relational information in the traits. We found that our method showed an increased power in detecting causal variants affecting correlated traits. Our results showed that, when correlation patterns among traits in a QTN are considered explicitly and directly during a structured multivariate genome association analysis using our proposed methods, the power of detecting true causal SNPs with possibly pleiotropic effects increased significantly without compromising performance on non-pleiotropic SNPs.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Seyoung Kim"", ids = ""1692950""); list(name = ""Eric P.

abf79e86c3ea07dbc47f62a3c0c6069859236280,A Sticky Weighted Regression Model for Time-Varying Resting-State Brain Connectivity Estimation,"Despite recent progress on brain connectivity modeling using neuroimaging data such as fMRI, most current approaches assume that brain connectivity networks have time-invariant topology/coefficients. This is clearly problematic as the brain is inherently nonstationary. Here, we present a time-varying model to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain connectivity networks. The proposed method allows for abrupt changes in network structure via a fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) scheme, as well as recovery of time-varying networks with smoothly changing coefficients via a weighted regression technique. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method yields improved accuracy on estimating time-dependent connectivity patterns when compared to a static sparse regression model or a weighted time-varying regression model. When applied to real resting-state fMRI datasets from Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects, significantly different temporal and spatial patterns were found to be associated with PD. Specifically, PD subjects demonstrated reduced network variability over time, which may be related to impaired cognitive flexibility previously reported in PD. The temporal dynamic properties of brain connectivity in PD subjects may provide insights into brain dynamics associated with PD and may serve as a potential biomarker in future studies.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aiping Liu"", ids = ""145341848""); list(name = ""Xun Chen"", ids = ""1807622""); list(name = ""Martin J.

03a93b577f44096ed16fe00930d1aa8e8da1c557,Structured penalized regression for drug sensitivity prediction.,"Large-scale {\it in vitro} drug sensitivity screens are an important tool in personalized oncology to predict the effectiveness of potential cancer drugs. The prediction of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs is a multivariate regression problem with high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-omics data as input data and with potentially strong correlations between the outcome variables which represent the sensitivity to the different drugs. We propose a joint penalized regression approach with structured penalty terms which allow us to utilize the correlation structure between drugs with group-lasso-type penalties and at the same time address the heterogeneity between omics data sources by introducing data-source-specific penalty factors to penalize different data sources differently. By combining integrative penalty factors (IPF) with tree-guided group lasso, we create the IPF-tree-lasso method. We present a unified framework to transform more general IPF-type methods to the original penalized method. Because the structured penalty terms have multiple parameters, we demonstrate how the interval-search Efficient Parameter Selection via Global Optimization (EPSGO) algorithm can be used to optimize multiple penalty parameters efficiently. Simulation studies show that IPF-tree-lasso can improve the prediction performance compared to other lasso-type methods, in particular for heterogenous data sources. Finally, we employ the new methods to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhi Zhao"", ids = ""116046714""); list(name = ""Manuela Zucknick"", ids = ""2693282"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,
